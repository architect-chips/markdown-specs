Scheduling operations for each unit are delegated to a co-processor or CPU; they operate on extremely fine-grained scheduling boundaries with each unit operating independently. This requirement for closely-managed scheduling can be made part of the NVDLA sub-system with the addition of a dedicated management coprocessor (\"headed\" implementation), or this functionality can be fused with the higher-level driver implementation on the main system processor (\"headless\" implementation).

The primary memory interface is intended to connect to the system's wider memory system, including system DRAM; this memory interface should be shared with the system's CPU and I/O peripherals. The second memory interface is optional, and allows for a connection to higher-bandwidth memory that may be dedicated to NVDLA or to a computer vision subsystem in general. This option for a heterogeneous memory interface enables additional flexibility for scaling between different types of host systems.</p><p>The typical flow for inferencing begins with the NVDLA management processor (either a microcontroller in a \"headed\" implementation, or the main CPU in a \"headless\" implementation) sending down the configuration of one hardware layer, along with an \"activate\" command. If data dependencies do not preclude this, multiple hardware layers can be sent down to different engines and activated at the same time (i.e., if there exists another layer whose inputs do not depend on the output from the previous layer). Because every engine has a double-buffer for its configuration registers, it can also capture a second layer's configuration to begin immediately processing when the active layer has completed. Once a hardware engine finishes its active task, it will issue an interrupt to the management processor to report the completion, and the management processor will then begin the process again.

This model is a good fit for cost-sensitive connected Internet of Things (IoT) class devices, AI and automation oriented systems that have well-defined tasks for which cost, area, and power are the primary drivers. Savings (in terms of cost, area, and power) are achieved through NVDLA configurable resources. Neural network models can be pre-compiled and performance optimized, allowing larger models to be \u201ccut down\u201d and reduced in load complexity; this, in turn, enables a scaled down NVDLA implementation where models consume less storage and take less time for system software to load and process.</p><p>These purpose-built systems typically execute only one task at a time, and as such, sacrificing system performance while NVDLA is operating is generally not a strong concern. The relatively inexpensive context switches associated with these systems \u2013 sometimes, as a result of processor architectural choices, and sometimes, as a result of using a system like FreeRTOS for task management \u2013 result in the main processor not being overly burdened by servicing a large number of NVDLA interrupts. This removes the need for an additional microcontroller, and the main processor performs both the coarse-grained scheduling and memory allocation, as well as the fine-grained NVDLA management.</p>",

Performance oriented IoT systems may perform inference on many different network topologies; as a result, it is important that these systems maintain a high degree of flexibility. Additionally, these systems may be performing many tasks at once, rather than serializing inference operations, so inference operations must not consume too much processing power on the host. To address these needs, the NVDLA hardware included a second (optional) memory interface for a dedicated high-bandwidth SRAM, and enables the ability to interface with a dedicated control coprocessor (microcontroller) to limit the interrupt load on the main processor.</p><p>When included in the implementation, a high-bandwidth SRAM is connected to a fast-memory bus interface port on NVDLA. This SRAM is used as a cache by NVDLA; optionally, it may be shared by other high-performance computer-vision-related components on the system to further reduce traffic to the main system memory (Sys DRAM).</p><p>Requirements for the NVDLA coprocessor are fairly typical; as such, there are many general purpose processors that would be appropriate (e.g., RISC-V-based PicoRV32 processors, ARM Cortex-M or Cortex-R processors, or even in-house microcontroller designs). When using a dedicated coprocessor, the host processor still handles some tasks associated with managing NVDLA. For instance, although the coprocessor becomes responsible for scheduling and fine-grained programming of the NVDLA hardware, the host will remain responsible for coarse-grained scheduling on the NVDLA hardware, for IOMMU mapping of NVDLA memory access (as necessary), for memory allocation of input data and fixed weight arrays on NVDLA, and for synchronization between other system components and tasks that run on NVDLA.</p><h2>Hardware Architecture</h2><p>The NVDLA architecture can be programmed in two modes of operation: independent mode, and fused mode.</p><ul><li><b>Independent.</b> When operating independently, each functional block is configured for when and what it executes, with each block working on its assigned task (akin to independent layers in a Deep Learning framework). Independent operation begins and ends with the assigned block performing memory-to-memory operations, in and out of main system memory or dedicated SRAM memory.</li><li><b>Fused.</b> Fused operation is similar to independent operation, however, some blocks can be assembled as a pipeline. This improves performance by bypassing the round trip through memory, instead having blocks communicate with each other through small FIFOs (i.e., the convolution core can pass data to the Single Data Point Processor, which can pass data to the Planar Data Processor, and in turn to the Cross-channel Data Processor).</li></ul>",

NVDLA functions as a slave on the CSB interface. CSB implements a very simple interface protocol so it can be easily converted to AMBA, OCP or any other system bus with a simple shim layer.</li><li><b>Interrupt interface.</b> NVDLA hardware includes a 1-bit level-driven interrupt. The interrupt line is asserted when a task has been completed or when an error occurs.</li><li><b>Data Backbone (DDB) interface.</b> The DDB interface connects NVDLA and the main system memory subsystems. It is a synchronous, high-speed, and highly configurable data bus. It can be specified to have different address sizes, different data sizes, and to issue different sizes of requests depending upon the requirements of the system. The data backbone interface is a simple interface protocol that is similar to AXI (and can be readily used in AXI-compliant systems).</li></ul><p>The DDB interface has an optional second connection which can be used when there is a second memory path available. This connection is identical in design to the primary DDB interface and is intended for use with an on-chip SRAM that can provide higher throughput and lower access latency. The second DDB interface is not necessary for NVDLA to function, systems that do not require this memory interface can save area by removing it.</p><h3>Components</h3><p>Each component in the NVDLA architecture exists to support specific operations integral to inference on deep neural networks. The following descriptions provide a brief functional overview of each block, including the TensorFlow operations that map onto them. While TensorFlow operations were provided as examples, NVDLA hardware supports other Deep Learning frameworks.</p><h3>Convolution</h3>",

The convolutional engine exposes parameters to map many different sizes of convolutions onto the hardware with high efficiency. The NVDLA convolution engine includes optimizations to improve performance over a naive convolution implementation. Support for sparse weight compression saves memory bandwidth.

This is commonly used immediately after convolution in CNN systems. The SDP has a lookup table to implement non-linear functions, or for linear functions it supports simple bias and scaling. This combination can support most common activation functions, as well as other element-wise operations, including ReLU, PReLU, precision scaling, batch normalization, bias addition, or other complex non-linear functions, such as a sigmoid or a hyperbolic tangent.</p><p>The SDP maps onto TensorFlow operations including <code>tf.nn.batch_normalization</code>, <code>tf.nn.bias_add</code>, <code>tf.nn.elu</code>, <code>tf.nn.relu</code>, <code>tf.sigmoid</code>, <code>tf.tanh</code>, and more.</p><h3>Planar Data Processor</h3><p>The Planar Data Processor (PDP) supports specific spatial operations that are common in CNN applications. It is configurable at runtime to support different pool group sizes, and supports three pooling functions: maximum-pooling, minimum-pooling, and average-pooling.</p><p>The PDP maps onto the <code>tf.nn.avg_pool</code>, <code>tf.nn.max_pool</code>, and <code>tf.nn.pool</code> operations.</p><h3>Cross-channel Data Processor</h3><p>The Cross-channel Data Processor (CDP) is a specialized unit built to apply the local response normalization (LRN) function \u2013 a special normalization function that operates on channel dimensions, as opposed to the spatial dimensions.</p><p>The CDP maps onto the <code>tf.nn.local_response_normalization</code> function.</p><h3>Data Reshape Engine</h3><p>The data reshape engine performs data format transformations (e.g., splitting or slicing, merging, contraction, reshape-transpose). Data in memory often needs to be reconfigured or reshaped in the process of performing inferencing on a convolutional network. For example, \"slice\" operations may be used to separate out different features or spatial regions of an image, and \"reshape-transpose\" operations (common in deconvolutional networks) create output data with larger dimensions than the input dataset.</p><p>The data reshape engine maps onto TensorFlow operations such as <code>tf.nn.conv2d_transpose</code>, <code>tf.concat</code>, <code>tf.slice</code>, and <code>tf.transpose</code>.</p><h3>Bridge DMA</h3>",

KMD feeds into NVDLA. The diagram is labeled (_images/nvdla-primer-sw-flow.svg).</div></div><p>Fig. 3 - Dataflow diagram inside of NVDLA system software.</p><h3>Compilation Tools: Model Creation and Compilation</h3><p>Compilation tools include compiler and parser. Compiler is responsible for creating a sequence of hardware layers that are optimized for a given NVDLA configuration; having an optimized network of hardware layers increases performance by reducing model size, load and run times. Compilation is a compartmentalized multi-step process that can be broken down into two basic components: parsing and compiling. The parser can be relatively simple; in its most basic incarnation, it can read a pre-trained Caffe model and create an \u201cintermediate representation\u201d of a network to pass to the next step of compilation. The compiler takes the parsed intermediate representation and the hardware configuration of an NVDLA implementation as its inputs, and generates a network of hardware layers. These steps are performed offline and might be performed on the device that contains the NVDLA implementation.</p><p>Knowing about the specific hardware configuration of an NVDLA implementation is important, it enables the compiler to generate appropriate layers for the features that are available. For example, this might include selecting between different convolution operation modes (such as Winograd convolution, or basic convolution), or splitting convolution operations into multiple smaller mini-operations depending on the available convolution buffer size. This phase is also responsible for quantizing models to lower precision, such as 8-bit or 16-bit integer, or 16-bit floating point, and for allocating memory regions for weights. The same compiler tool can be used to generate a list of operations for multiple different NVDLA configurations.</p><h3>Runtime Environment: Model Inference on Device</h3><p>The runtime environment involves running a model on compatible NVDLA hardware. It is effectively divided into two layers:</p><ul><li><b>User Mode Driver.</b> The main interface with user-mode programs. After parsing the neural network compiler compiles network layer by layer and converts it into a file format called NVDLA Loadable (glossary.html#term-NVDLA-Loadable). User mode runtime driver loads this loadable and submits inference job to Kernel Mode Driver (sw/runtime_environment.html#kernel-mode-driver)</li><li><b>Kernel Mode Driver.</b> Consists of drivers and firmware that do the work of scheduling layer operations on NVDLA and programming the NVDLA registers to configure each functional block.</li></ul><p>The runtime execution starts with a stored representation of the network; this stored format is called an \u201cNVDLA loadable\u201d image. In the view of a loadable, each functional block in the NVDLA implementation is represented by a \u201clayer\u201d in software; each layer includes information about its dependencies, the tensors that it uses in as inputs and outputs in memory, and the specific configuration of each block for an operation. Layers are linked together through a dependency graph, which KMD uses to schedule each operation. The format of an NVDLA loadable is standardized across compiler implementations and UMD implementations. All implementations that comply with the NVDLA standard should be able to at least understand any NVDLA loadable image, even if the implementation may not have some features that are required to run inference using that loadable image.</p>",

Compiler is responsible for creating a sequence of hardware layers that are optimized for a given NVDLA configuration; having an optimized network of hardware layers increases performance by reducing model size, load and run times. Compilation is a compartmentalized multi-step process that can be broken down into two basic components: parsing and compiling. The parser can be relatively simple; in its most basic incarnation, it can read a pre-trained Caffe model and create an \u201cintermediate representation\u201d of a network to pass to the next step of compilation. The compiler takes the parsed intermediate representation and the hardware configuration of an NVDLA implementation as its inputs, and generates a network of hardware layers. These steps are performed offline and might be performed on the device that contains the NVDLA implementation.</p>",

This phase is also responsible for quantizing models to lower precision, such as 8-bit or 16-bit integer, or 16-bit floating point, and for allocating memory regions for weights.

Maintaining core implementations within a portability layer is expected to require relatively few changes and expedite any effort where it may be necessary to run an NVDLA software-stack on multiple platforms; with the appropriate portability layers in place, the same core implementations should compile as readily on both Linux and FreeRTOS. Similarly, on \u201cheaded\u201d implementations that have a microcontroller closely coupled to NVDLA, the existence of the portability layer makes it possible to run the same low-level software on the microcontroller as would run on the main CPU in a \u201cheadless\u201d implementations that has no such companion processor.</p><h3>NVDLA System Integration</h3><p>NVDLA can be configured for a wide range of performance levels; choosing these parameters depends on the requirements for Convolutional Neural Network(s) (CNN) that will be executed. This section describes some of the factors that will influence the choice of these parameters, and some considerations of their impact on system area and performance. The time required to run each layer is the maximum amount of the time required for data input, output, and the time required to perform the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. The time required to run the whole network is equal to the sum of times for all the layers. Choosing the correct number of MAC units, the convolutional buffer size, and the on-chip SRAM size for the desired performance are the most</p>",

The time required to run each layer is the maximum amount of the time required for data input, output, and the time required to perform the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. The time required to run the whole network is equal to the sum of times for all the layers.

NVDLA has many more configuration parameters for additional performance tuning that require careful consideration, these will have less impact on the total area; they should be configured to not become unnecessary bottlenecks.</p><h2>Tuning Questions</h2><h3>What math precision is required for the workloads expected for any given instantiation?</h3><p>The bulk of the NVDLA area in larger configurations is used by convolution buffers and by MAC units, and so it stands to reason that these parameters are the most important in an initial performance / area tradeoff analysis. Deep Learning training is usually done at 32-bit floating point precision, but the resulting networks can often be reduced to 8-bit integers without significant loss of inference quality; in some cases, however, it may still be desirable to use 16-bit integers or floating point numbers.</p><h3>What are the number of MAC units, and the required memory bandwidth?</h3><p>After precision, the next two critical parameters for performance and area are the number of MAC units, and the required memory bandwidth. When configuring NVDLA, these should be carefully considered. Processing happens layer-by-layer, and so performance estimation is best done layer-by-layer, as well. For any given layer, it is usually the case that either MAC throughput or memory bandwidth will be the bottleneck.</p><p>The number of MAC units required is relatively easy to determine. For example, a convolutional layer has a known input and output resolution, and a known number of input and output features; the convolution kernel size is also known. Multiplying these together gives the total number of MAC operations to process the layer. The hardware can be defined to have a certain number of MAC units; dividing the number of operations required by the number of MAC units gives a lower bound for the number of clock cycles that a layer can be processed in.</p><p>Calculating required memory bandwidth is less trivial. In the ideal case, it should only be necessary to read the input image once, the output image once, and the weights once, and the minimum number of cycles will be the sum of those divided by the number of samples that can be read or written per clock. However, if the convolutional buffer is too small to hold the support region for the input and the set of weights, multiple passes are required. For example, if the convolutional buffer can only hold a fourth of the weight data, then the calculation must be split into four steps, multiplying the input bandwidth (i.e., 10MB of input memory traffic would multiply to 40MB). Similarly, if the buffers cannot hold enough lines for a support region for the convolution, the convolution must also be broken up into horizontal strips. This effect is important to consider when choosing the convolutional buffer size, and when sizing the memory interface.</p><h3>Is there a need for on-chip SRAM?</h3><p>If external memory bandwidth is at a premium for power or performance reasons, then adding on-chip SRAM can help. Such SRAM can be thought of as a second-level cache; it can have higher bandwidth than the main memory, and that bandwidth is additive to the main memory bandwidth. An on-chip SRAM is less expensive to implement than a larger convolutional buffer, which needs wide ports and has very stringent timing requirements, but does not have as greatly multiplicative of a factor in applications that are convolutional-buffer-limited. (For instance, if a layer is bandwidth limited, adding a SRAM that is sufficient to hold the entire input image that runs at twice the speed of the system's DRAM can double the performance. However, if the layer is also limited by convolutional buffer size, the same amount of memory could produce a much greater multiplier to system throughput.) The simplest way to consider this tradeoff is that adding convolutional buffer size will help to reduce the bandwidth requirement, while adding an on-chip SRAM can improve the total available bandwidth.</p>",

In the ideal case, it should only be necessary to read the input image once, the output image once, and the weights once, and the minimum number of cycles will be the sum of those divided by the number of samples that can be read or written per clock. However, if the convolutional buffer is too small to hold the support region for the input and the set of weights, multiple passes are required. For example, if the convolutional buffer can only hold a fourth of the weight data, then the calculation must be split into four steps, multiplying the input bandwidth (i.e., 10MB of input memory traffic would multiply to 40MB). Similarly, if the buffers cannot hold enough lines for a support region for the convolution, the convolution must also be broken up into horizontal strips. This effect is important to consider when choosing the convolutional buffer size, and when sizing the memory interface.</p>",

Such SRAM can be thought of as a second-level cache; it can have higher bandwidth than the main memory, and that bandwidth is additive to the main memory bandwidth. An on-chip SRAM is less expensive to implement than a larger convolutional buffer, which needs wide ports and has very stringent timing requirements, but does not have as greatly multiplicative of a factor in applications that are convolutional-buffer-limited. (For instance, if a layer is bandwidth limited, adding a SRAM that is sufficient to hold the entire input image that runs at twice the speed of the system's DRAM can double the performance. However, if the layer is also limited by convolutional buffer size, the same amount of memory could produce a much greater multiplier to system throughput.) The simplest way to consider this tradeoff is that adding convolutional buffer size will help to reduce the bandwidth requirement, while adding an on-chip SRAM can improve the total available bandwidth.</p>",

A minimum SoC system configuration consists of a CPU, an NVDLA instance, an interconnect, and memories. These platforms can be used for software development, or as a starting point for integrating NVDLA into an industrial-strength SoC.</p><h3>Simulation</h3><p>The NVDLA open source release includes a simulation platform based on GreenSocs QBox. In this platform, a QEMU CPU model (x86 or ARMv8) is combined with the NVDLA SystemC model, providing a register-accurate system on which software can be quickly developed and debugged. The Linux kernel-mode driver and a user-mode test utility are provided to run on this simulation platform.</p><h3>FPGA</h3><p>This sample platform maps the NVDLA Verilog model onto an FPGA, it provides a synthesizable example of instantiating NVDLA in a real design. In this platform, the NVDLA SystemC model is not used, software register reads and writes execute directly on the real RTL environment. This allows for limited cycle-counting performance evaluation, and also allows for even faster testing of software against larger, more complex networks. The FPGA model is intended for validation only, no effort has been made to optimize cycle time, design size, or power for the FPGA platform, performance of the FPGA model is not directly comparable against other FPGA-based Deep Learning accelerators</p><p>The FPGA system model uses the Amazon EC2 \"F1\" environment, which is a publicly available standardized FPGA system that can be leased by the hour. No up-front purchase of specialized hardware or software is necessary to use this model; the synthesis software is available for only the cost of compute time on the Amazon EC2 environment, and the hardware requires no commitment to gain access to. Because the FPGA platform is Xilinx-based, migration to other Virtex-family devices should be relatively straightforward.</p>",

      "html": "<h3>Models</h3><p>NVDLA IP-core models are based on open industry standards. The simplistic design and use of basic constructs are expected to easily integrate in typical SoC design flows.</p><h3>Verilog model</h3><p>The Verilog model provides a synthesis and simulation model in RTL form. It has four functional interfaces: a slave host interface, an interrupt line, and two master interfaces for internal and external memory access. The host and memory interfaces are very simple, but require external bus adapters to connect to an existing SoC design; for convenience, sample adapters for AXI4 and TileLink are included as part of the NVDLA open source release. The NVDLA open source release contains example synthesis scripts. To facilitate physical design on more complex systems or larger instantiations of NVDLA, the design is split into partitions that each can be handled independently in the SoC backend flow. The interfaces between the partitions can be retimed as needed to meet routing requirements.</p><p>The NVDLA core operates in a single clock domain; bus adapters allow for clock domain crossing from the internal NVDLA clock to the bus clocks. Similarly, NVDLA also operates in a single power domain; the design applies both fine- and coarse-grain power gating. If added to implementation, SRAMs are modelled by behavioral models and must be replaced by compiled RAMs in a full SoC design. The NVDLA design requires implementations of both single-ported and dual-ported (one read port plus one write port) SRAMs.</p><h3>Simulation model and verification suite</h3><p>NVDLA includes a TLM2 SystemC simulation model for software development, system integration, and testing. This model enables much faster simulation than would otherwise be available by running the RTL in conjunction with signal-stimulus models. This SystemC model is intended to be used in full-SoC simulation environments, such as Synopsys VDK or the provided GreenSocs QBox platform. The included model is parameterizable on the same axes as is the RTL model, for direct comparison and simulation.</p><p>The simulation model can also be used with the NVDLA testbench and verification suite. The light-weight trace-player-based testbench is suitable for simple synthesis and build health verification (this will be available with the initial NVDLA release). A full verification environment with extensive unit-by-unit testing will become available in subsequent release. The verification suite can be used to provide design assurance before tape-out, including verifying changes for compiled RAMs, clock-gating, and scan-chain insertion. This environment will be suitable for making more substantial changes (e.g., verify new NVDLA configurations or modifications made to an existing NVDLA design).</p><h2>Software</h2><p>The initial NVDLA open-source release includes software for a \u201cheadless\u201d implementation, compatible with Linux. Both a kernel-mode driver and a user-mode test utility are provided in source form, and can run on top of otherwise-unmodified Linux systems.</p><h2>Appendix: Deep Learning references</h2><p>This document assumes some amount of familiarity with general concepts pertaining to Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.
