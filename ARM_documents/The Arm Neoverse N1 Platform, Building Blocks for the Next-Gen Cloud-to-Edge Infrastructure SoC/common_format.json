This demand has skyrocketed with the move to the public cloud and 5G networking, where compute nodes must operate within strict latency constraints and power budgets. The Neoverse N1 platform is Arm's latest high-end offering from a scalable portfolio of IP for high performance and energy efficient machines.</p><p><b>NEOVERSE N1</b> is the new platform of Arm IPs that enables partners to develop systems with competitive performance and world-leading power efficiency across a wide range of markets. On one end of the spectrum, the Neoverse N1 platform is well suited for high performance systems with up to 128 cores organized on an 8x8 mesh. At the same time, customers targeting deployments with strict power and area constraints can rely on Neoverse N1 to create high-efficiency and high-performance systems composed of a dozen or fewer general-purpose cores.</p><p>The Neoverse N1 core implements the v8.2-A A32, T32, and A64 Arm instruction sets and includes many infrastructure-focused improvements such as security features, Virtualization Host Extensions, Large System Extensions and RAS Extensions.</p><p>Our projections and silicon measurements show that the Neoverse N1 core performs at least 1.6x better for most workloads than Arm's previous design deployed in infrastructure\u2014the Arm Cortex-A72\u2014with some cloud-native workloads performing up to 2.5x faster. This important speed up was achieved without compromising our best in class power-efficiency. Additionally, scalability significantly improved thanks to a completely redesigned coherent mesh, cache hierarchy, and system IP backplane. As a result, Arm's silicon partners using Neoverse N1 in their designs have numerous opportunities to organize and optimize these components to satisfy their general-purpose compute needs and can take advantage of the many connectivity options for tightly coupling accelerators through technologies such as AMBA, CCIX, and PCIe.</p>",

Neoverse N1 also includes the new CRC32 instructions to accelerate storage applications. Additionally, particular focus has been placed on finer handling of Arm's relaxed memory ordering through the LDAPR instruction (load with ordering semantics similar to Load-Acquire, Store-Release) the introduction of Limited Ordering Regions, support for atomic instructions, and support for persistent memory.</p><p>We also included several features to significantly harden Neoverse N1 against known security vulnerabilities:</p><ul><li>Privileged Access Never (PAN): protects the OS kernel from being \"spoofed\" into reading or writing user code or data on behalf of malicious programs</li><li>Unprivileged Access Override (UAO): allows the OS kernel to more efficiently manage user code sections that are marked as execute-only for protection</li><li>Stage 2 execute-never: allows the hypervisor to prevent an OS kernel and/or application from executing pages containing writable data, to prevent some exploits</li><li>Side-channel protection: introduces a range of new speculation controls, speculation barrier, and prediction restriction instructions that allow software to mitigate micro-architectural side-channel attacks on speculative execution across different execution contexts</li></ul><p>Virtualization is the backbone of much of the modern IT infrastructure, and Neoverse N1 implements enhancements to extend virtualization support and reduce its overhead:</p><ul><li>Hardware update of access/dirty bits: automatically updates status bits in page table entries, avoiding a trap to the OS or hypervisor</li><li>VMID extension to 16 bits: increases the maximum number of simultaneously active virtual machines supported by the address translation system to 65536</li><li>Virtual Host Extension (VHE): more efficient support for Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors, such as KVM, building on the Type 1 (native) hypervisor support already introduced in base Armv8-A</li></ul><p>Finally, we extended our performance monitoring infrastructure to support enhanced PMU events and statistical profiling.</p>",

To achieve this goal, the team designed the microarchitecture from scratch and focused on features to enhance infrastructure-focused many-core CPU performance.</p><p>Neoverse N1 supports an aggressive out-of-order superscalar pipeline and implements a 4-wide front-end with the capability of dispatching/committing up to 8 instructions per cycle. The core deploys three ALUs, a branch execution unit, two Advanced SIMD units, and two load/store execution units. The minimum misprediction penalty is 11-cycle, and we introduced many optimizations in order to preserve a short pipeline without losing power efficiency.</p><p>The next sections describe the detail of Neoverse-N1 core microarchitecture. The first two sections describe the core front-end and back-end. The following sections detail the interaction of the core with the memory subsystem, security features, and features added to target the infrastructure market. This section will conclude with a few figures of merit about the core implementation.</p><h3>Core Front-end</h3><p>The Neoverse N1 core can fetch up to 4 instructions per cycle to feed its high-performance back-end. One of the biggest improvements from Cortex-A72 is a decoupled branch prediction, which realizes a branch predictor directed prefetch, where the branch predictor can run ahead even if the front-end pipeline is waiting for instruction cache (I-cache) miss refill responses. Even if the I-cache pipeline is stalled on an instruction fetch miss, speculative fetch addresses provided by the branch predictor can continue to access the I-cache and resolve misses through early prefetches.</p><p>The branch predictor employs a large 6K-entry main branch target buffer with 3-cycle access latency to retrieve branches' target addresses without accessing the I-cache. Such a sizeable BTB unit helps maintain target history for a large number of branches, which benefits cloud and server workloads with large instruction footprints. The predictor also employs a 64-entry micro-BTB and a 16-entry nano-BTB to minimize bubbles in the front-end. Neoverse N1 also significantly improves both latency and accuracy of the indirect branch prediction algorithm. The branch direction predictor is also optimized to target behaviors observed on many server workloads: once a prediction is made, the predicted address is stored into a 12-entry fetch queue which tracks future fetch transactions.</p><p>Once the branch predictor creates a next fetch address, the address is fed into a fully associative 48-entry instruction TLB and a 4-wayset-associative 64KB I-cache to read out the instruction opcode. The I-cache can deliver up to 16B of instructions per cycle.</p>",

Neoverse N1 implements a number of features targeted to this class of machines.</p><p>One of these features is the support for hardware coherent I-caches. Like other architectures, the Arm architecture does not require I-caches to maintain coherent through hardware mechanisms. Hence, on legacy Arm systems, software must issue the necessary cache maintenance operations whenever memory containing instructions is modified. Typically, these invalidations are broadcast to all cores within the same coherency domain to realize transparent instruction memory access. Unfortunately, such broadcasts can limit scalability on high core count systems. Neoverse N1 eliminates this bottleneck by implementing a fully hardware coherent I-cache that requires no software maintenance and leverages the same hardware coherency mechanisms utilized by the data cache. To ensure software compatibility, unnecessary I-cache maintenance operations still issued by legacy software are treated as 'no operation' in the core. For more recent software, Neoverse N1 includes a status bit that allows users to discover that the I-cache is hardware coherent, hence cache maintenance instructions are not necessary.</p><p>Another infrastructure feature added by Neoverse N1 is the support for the Arm v8.2 RAS architecture. The RAS architecture provides a framework for detecting, classifying, and reporting errors that is consistent across all components of the SoC. Neoverse N1 also adds the ability to defer errors from one component to another. For example, an uncorrectable data ECC error in DRAM can be propagated to a core which can cache the corrupted data but flag the erroneous word as 'poisoned'. When an instruction such as a load consumes the poisoned data, it generates an exception. If the poisoned data is never consumed by the core, the data will eventually be evicted from the core caches but will retain the poison information in the system-level-cache or DRAM.</p><p>Finally, Neoverse N1 increases the ASID and VMID widths to 16 bits, allowing for more guest operating systems and applications within each guest. Neoverse N1 also extends the physical address width to 48-bit, allowing systems to support up to 256TB of physical memory.</p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>The Neoverse N1 core design was fully evaluated within our internal development environment. Figure 1 shows the core floorplan of our reference implementation, which employs a 64KB I-cache, a 64KB D-cache, and 1MB L2 cache.</p><p>Our optimized physical implementations indicate that the core and L2 cache can reach an operating frequency of 3.1GHz. When executing an intense integer workload, the estimated power consumption for a 7nm implementation of a core is 1.0W and 1.8W</p>",

CHI is a packet-based, point-to-point, topology agnostic, layered architecture protocol. The coherent interconnect is a vital component to enable many-core systems to scale without compromising latency and available memory bandwidth. A mesh topology was chosen to address those challenges and is designed to address those challenges and is designed to support one clock cycle delay per hop. CMN-600 can scale from a 1x2 mesh to a 8x8 mesh and is designed to operate at up to 2GHz clock frequency. Customers can configure mesh size, topology, and bisection BW to match the architecture that best fits their PPA targets.</p><p>CMN-600 includes a distributed set of fully coherent home nodes which are software-configurable hash address-interleaved. Software-configurability allows customers to support different hash interleaving granularity, with the minimum interleave being 64Bytes. Such configurability enables traffic distribution and traffic isolation based on the characteristics of the targeted applications and allows affinity-based system cache groups (SCG) allocation, which helps with traffic localization in bigger systems.</p><p>Each HN-F slice includes a snoop filter and a system level cache (SLC) with enhanced replacement policies. System architects that adopt the Neoverse N1 platform can choose the number of HN-F slices to deploy on system cache capacity needed and system bandwidth requirement, and total SLC capacity can range from 0MB to 256MB.</p><p>The SLC is a victim cache for core clusters with adaptive cache allocation based on data-sharing detection. SLC also acts as a DRAM cache for IO Requestors (PCIe, DMA etc.) with a smart allocation policy. In addition, the SLC supports software programmable source-based cache capacity control which mitigates the \"noisy-neighbor\" shared system cache thrashing problem.</p><p>Some key performance enhancement features of CMN-600 include:</p><ul><li>Support for Arm and PCIe architecture atomic transactions at the home nodes. This allows atomic transactions to be issued by the cores to the home nodes, where they are resolved. The capability to execute far atomics operations improves performance for contended variable updates</li></ul>",

CHI is a packet-based, point-to-point, topology agnostic, layered architecture protocol. The coherent interconnect is a vital component to enable many-core systems to scale without compromising latency and available memory bandwidth. A mesh topology was chosen to address those challenges and is designed to address those challenges and is designed to support one clock cycle delay per hop. CMN-600 can scale from a 1x2 mesh to a 8x8 mesh and is designed to operate at up to 2GHz clock frequency. Customers can configure mesh size, topology, and bisection BW to match the architecture that best fits their PPA targets.</p>",

When SLC stashing is enabled, silicon measurements show improvements up to 33% packet/second on a single core and up to 60% on multicore tests for DPDK L3 Forwarding tests. Further improvements are expected for applications that can stash IO data in the cores' private L2 or in the core cluster L3</li></ul><p>CMN-600 is designed to support high throughput IO traffic from various requesters such as DMA, PCIe, etc., and can achieve full PCIe Gen4 upstream and downstream bandwidth.

These runtime environments are the foundation of much of the applications running in the cloud and are a natural target for our design. At a high level, on Neoverse N1 we focused on a few relevant stressors for these workloads:</p><ol><li>Object management: up to 2.4x more memory allocations and 1.6x faster in copying characters on Java microbenchmarks vs Cortex-A72</li><li>Managing the instruction footprint: on a Java-Based-Benchmark, I-cache miss rate and branch mispredictions was reduced by 1.4x and 2.25x vs Cortex-A72, respectively</li><li>Process synchronization for garbage collection: locking throughput and latency improved by 2x thanks to the Large System Extensions Arm atomic instructions</li></ol><p>We expect to see higher performance gains as Neoverse N1 systems become more broadly available for software optimizations and application tuning [5]. At the time of writing, Arm partners report that initial evaluations of real-world workloads on systems deploying Neoverse N1 show up to 40% better performance compared to similarly configured systems currently on the market.</p>",
