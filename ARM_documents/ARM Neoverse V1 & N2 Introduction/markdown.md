#### EPI: HPC IN A CAR WORK PACKAGE SIPEARL/ BMW/ INFINEON...

« SiPearl is working on a demonstrator on Neoverse N1 SDP platform with other EPI members (BMW, Infineon...)

- N1 SDP will be embedded in a car and will perform trajectory planning using all sensor data provided by other systems.
- Trajectory information will be sent to head unit for driver information.

We are using open source frameworks like ApolloAuto or Autoware.Ai to evaluate performance of those algorithm on N1 cores,

The data collected during this demo will be used to optimize those algorithm for our next generation of products using V1 cores. »

#### NeoVerse V1 Power ManagementTools to better fit/fill the power/thermal envelope

##### Max Power Mitigation Mechanism (MPMM)

- Don't have to provision systems for the worst-case CPU power
- Allows running at max frequency when in high core counts
- Introduce 3 different 'gears' to allow for a wider range of throttling for a given workload profile

Throttling power viruses

Throttling high-bandwidth vector workloads

Aggressive throttling vector/fp workloads, with minimal integer impact

##### Dispatch Throttling (DT)

- For more aggressive throttling, when needed beyond MPMM
- Engaged in periods of high IPC activity (Int + Vec/FP)

#### Neoverse N2 Efficient Performance

#### Our approach beyond N1

- Performance features must pay for themselves
  - Power- and area-efficiency
- Optimize efficiency of existing structures across the board
- Relative to Neoverse V1
  - Relies less on the ‘width’ and ‘depth’ performance levers in the mid-core
    - 5-wide dispatch
    - 160+ instr ROB
  - Reduced amount of speculation throughout
  - 2x128 SVE/Neon/FP datapath
  - Reduced load-store bandwidth

![A graph showing Relative Power & Area (Y-axis) versus Relative Performance (X-axis). The curve is labeled N1 and N2. N1 is at a lower relative performance and relative power/area. N2 is at a higher relative performance and relative power/area, indicating improved efficiency.](da0d310d0e9ecc6bfd61fe15aad963aa_img.jpg)

#### NeoVerse N2 Efficient PerformanceSimilarities with NeoVerse V1

- N2 inherits many of the efficient “smarts” that went into NeoVerse V1
  - Branch-prediction algorithms
  - Data-prefetching algorithms
  - Replacement policies
- Front-end very similar to NeoVerse V1
  - Important for infrastructure applications with large instruction footprints and complex branch behavior
  - Also has a Mop Cache for accelerating smaller kernels (1.5K entry)

Diagram illustrating the performance and generation relationship between NeoVerse N1, V1, and N2.

The vertical axis is labeled "Perf" (Performance) and the horizontal axis is labeled "Generation".

Three generations are shown: N1 (blue), V1 (orange), and N2 (green).

- N1 is positioned lower on the Performance axis and further left on the Generation axis.
- V1 is positioned higher on the Performance axis and further right on the Generation axis.
- N2 is positioned higher on the Performance axis and further right on the Generation axis than V1.

Arrows indicate relationships: N1 points to V1, V1 points to N2, and N1 points to N2.

#### NeoVerse N2 Power ManagementTools to better fit the power & thermal envelope

- Similar capabilities from NeoVerse V1, plus...
- Performance Defined Power Management (PDP)
  - Dynamic scaling of the Uarch to maximize efficiency for the given workload
    - The CPU knows how to do this best
  - Targeting width, depth, speculation (internally and externally) for scaling
    - Not every workload requires maximum of these for unleashing performance
  - High efficiency scaling compared to MPMM & DT
