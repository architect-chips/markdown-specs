However, there is no specific vector length that is well suited to all applications.</p><p>Due to the relatively high encoding cost of specifying a new instruction set each time a need for a new vector length arises, Arm adopted a novel approach and created a unique instruction set that scales on different vector lengths. This next generation Arm SIMD instruction set is called Scalable Vector Extension (SVE). It permits vector length agnostic coding style where the code does not need to be re-written or re-compiled since it dynamically adapts to the implemented vector length. The SVE architecture allows implementations with a vector length up to 2048-bits, where vector length must be a multiple of 128-bits. SVE also supports code written for a fixed vector length.</p><p>The vectorization approach facilitated by the Armv8-A Advanced SIMD instruction set is sensitive to situations where the loop count is not a multiple of the vector length. To accommodate this, an Armv8-A Advanced SIMD vectorized loop is followed by a scalar loop that processes the remaining data. The vector partitioning mechanism supported by SVE allows control over which elements of a vector are operated on. This enables easier handling of loop termination conditions. The suite of carefully selected instructions converts conditional statements or control flow into predicated vector operations enabling seamless loop control. Consequently, most complex nested loops become vectorizable.</p><p>SVE supports reduction instructions for a number of arithmetic operations. These instructions enable such vectorizations where partial results are calculated in distinct vector lanes. The final result is obtained from these partial results with the help of a reduction instruction after the completion of the vectorized loop.</p><p>The SVE instruction set provides extensive load/store instruction support, predicate and loop control support, and logical and bitwise instructions support. The SVE instruction set also provides thorough floating-point arithmetic support, and basic integer arithmetic support.</p><p>SVE2, the Scalable Vector Extension v2, is a superset of the Armv8-A SVE with expanded functionality.

The lower 128 bits of the SVE vector registers overlap with the SIMD and floating point registers, as shown in Figure A1.1 <i>SIMD/Floating-point registers and SVE registers</i>. This makes it possible to interchangeably use SVE instructions with the Advanced SIMD instructions, and a particular register can be written to by the SVE instruction and then read by the Advanced SIMD instruction, and vice versa. When an Advanced SIMD or a floating-point instruction writes to the SIMD and floating point registers, bits[<math>V_L - 1 : 128</math>] of the corresponding SVE vector register are zeroed.</p>",

Then, the memory system can respond by preloading the specified address into one or more caches, therefore speeding up the upcoming memory access execution. The prefetch instructions are only hints. Hence, they have a minimal impact on actual execution but can improve performance significantly if issued in a timely manner.</p><p>The instructions <code>PRFB</code>, <code>PRFH</code>, <code>PRFW</code> and <code>PRFD</code>, allow contiguous or gather prefetch of bytes, half-words, words or double-words. Prefetch can be for load or for store, and the target is one of L1, L2, L3 caches.</p><p>The coding example with prefetch instructions can be found in <a href=\"#\">A4.1.3 For/While loop SVE vectorization with prefetching</a>.</p><h4>A3.3.9 Memory ordering</h4><p>Memory reads occur out of order:</p><ul><li>Two reads of the same location by different load instructions occur in any order.</li><li>Multiple element reads of the same vector load instruction occur in any order.</li></ul><p>Memory writes mostly occur out of order:</p><ul><li>Multiple element writes by the same vector store instruction occur in any order, except when writes are to the same location and then they occur in element indices order.</li></ul>",

In these SVE instructions, some or all source vector elements contribute to destination vector resulting elements from a different 128-bits vector granule, hence crossing the 128-bits granule boundary.

The goal is to load and process enough elements to maximally fill up the available vector length in a vector length agnostic manner.

In later sections, more complex data rearrangements and loop unrolling examples and tips will be illustrated.</p><p>In the following FIR filtering example, a multiply-add operation on the 32-bit wide elements is performed in a loop.

Therefore, two complex multiply-accumulate instructions, <code>CMLA</code> or <code>SQRDCMLAH</code>, are necessary to calculate the entire complex-valued multiply-accumulate. These instructions take an additional argument, the rotation parameter, with values #0, #90, #180 or #270.</p><p>Here are some complex multiplication calculation examples with the accumulation part omitted:</p><table><thead><tr><th>src1</th><th>src2</th><th>result</th><th>CMLA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><math>a + i*b</math></td><td><math>x + i*y</math></td><td><math>src1 * src2 = (a*x - b*y) + i*(a*y + b*x)</math></td><td>#0, #90</td></tr><tr><td><math>a + i*b</math></td><td><math>x + i*y</math></td><td><math>src1 * src2 = (a*x + b*y) + i*(a*y - b*x)</math></td><td>#0, #270</td></tr><tr><td><math>a + i*b</math></td><td><math>x + i*y</math></td><td><math>-src1 * src2 = (-a*x + b*y) + i*(-a*y - b*x)</math></td><td>#270, #180</td></tr></tbody></table><h5>A5.2.3 Complex-valued integer dot product</h5><p>The SVE2 instruction set implements signed complex-valued integer dot product accumulation with instruction <code>CDOT</code>, as:</p><p><math display=\"block\">c_i = a_{2i} * b_{2i} + a_{2i+1} * b_{2i+1}</math></p><p>The result element size can be either complex-valued 32-bit or 64-bit, while the input element size is <math>1/4</math> of the result element size to minimise the risk of overflow. In the case of a 32-bit result element, two signed complex-valued 8-bit input elements are taken from the corresponding 32-bit lane of each input operand. In the case of a 64-bit result element, two signed complex-valued 16-bit input elements are taken from the corresponding 64-bit lane of each input operand.</p><p>The complex-valued integer dot product instruction takes two source vectors with its elements real and imaginary parts organized in interleaved order. On the contrary, the result produced by these instructions is in de-interleaved format, and hence two <code>CDOT</code> instructions are needed: one for producing the real part of the result, and another one for producing the imaginary part of the result. These instructions take an additional argument, the rotation parameter, with values #0, #90, #180 or #270. Figure A5.1 <i>Complex-valued dot product and rotation parameter</i> illustrates the result computation depending on the rotation parameter value.</p>",

For each input array, a and b, a separate pointer is defined for each of its two vectors processed within one loop iteration. All input and output pointers share the same offset count. For example, the pointer aPtr_1st with the offset count is used to load the first vector length elements group of input vector a, while the pointer aPtr with the offset count is used to load the second vector length elements group of input vector a. Similar applies to vector b loads and to the results store.</p><p block-type=\"Text\">The count is re-used as a loop counter, and updated at line 43. In this way, the number of registers that need to be updated in each loop iteration is minimized. Only the second vector length elements load is truly predicated by p4. This works correctly since with the instruction B.NFRST at line 17 and the instruction B.FIRST at line 46, it is checked whether there are more than one vector length input elements remaining, and only in that case the vectorized loop starting at line 23 is entered. Otherwise, the termination code processing the remaining input elements of the first vector length group (lines 48-59) is executed.</p><pre>1 size .req x0 // int64_t n\n2 aPtr .req x1 // cplx_int16_t * a\n3 bPtr .req x2 // cplx_int16_t * b\n4 outPtr .req x3 // cplx_int16_t * c\n5\n6 aPtr_1st .req x4\n7 bPtr_1st .req x5\n8 outPtr_1st .req x6\n9 count .req x7\n10\n11 PTRUE p2.h\n12 LSL size, size, #1</pre>",

And similarly, in order to compute the final result imaginary part, it is necessary to perform the reduction addition of partial imaginary part results only. Because of that, with the instructions UZP1 and UZP2 at lines 43-44, the real and imaginary parts of the partial sums are de-interleaved, with the partial real part sums moved to register z10, and the partial imaginary part sums moved to register z11.

And similarly, in order to compute the final result imaginary part, it is necessary to perform the reduction addition of partial imaginary part results only. Because of that, with the instructions UZP1 and UZP2 at lines 43-44, the real and imaginary parts of the partial sums are de-interleaved, with the partial real part sums moved to register z10, and the partial imaginary part sums moved to register z11. The reduction additions are computed with the instruction FADDV, for real part at line 45, and for imaginary part at line 46.

The inner loop starting at line 23 iterates over the filter taps producing vector length results (machine vector length/int16_t size). The FIR filtering computation is implemented with the top-bottom widening integer multiply <code>SMULLB</code> and <code>SMULLT</code> instructions (lines 20-21) and the top-bottom widening integer multiply-accumulate <code>SMLALB</code> and <code>SMLALT</code> instructions (lines 30-31) described in <a href=\"#\">A5.1.1 Top-Bottom processing approach</a> and <a href=\"#\">A5.1.2 Top-Bottom widening instructions</a>. The instructions at lines 20-21 and 30-31, take as source elements 16-bit integer data and produce 32-bit integer results, hence maintaining the full precision. Since the result elements are twice as large as the source elements, to process all input data previously loaded, two instructions are needed: one bottom (lines 20, 30) and one top (lines 21, 31) instruction.</p><p>The final FIR filtering 16-bit integer results are obtained by extracting the high 16-bits out of the FIR filtering 32-bit integer results by bottom <code>SQSHRNB</code> (line 35) and top <code>SQSHRNT</code> (line 36) instructions. With the pair of instructions <code>SQSHRNB</code> and <code>SQSHRNT</code> (lines 35-36) also achieved is the interleaving of even and odd results, recovering the original input data sequence order before storing them to the memory at line 37.</p><pre>1 size .req x0 // int64_t n\n2 taps .req x1 // int64_t t\n3 xPtr .req x2 // int16_t * x\n4 hPtr .req x3 // int16_t * h\n5 yPtr .req x4 // int16_t * y\n6\n7 ADD size, yPtr, size, LSL #1\n8 WHILELT p4.b, yPtr, size\n9 ADD taps, hPtr, taps, LSL #1\n10 PTRUE p5.h\n11 B.NONE .L_return\n12\n13 .L_FIR_outer_loop:\n14 MOV x6, #0\n15 MOV x8, hPtr\n16 LD1H z2.h, p4/z, [xPtr, x6, LSL #1]\n17 LD1RH z1.h, p5/z, [x8]\n18 ADD x6, x6, #1\n19 ADD x8, x8, #2\n20 SMULLB z10.s, z2.h, z1.h\n21 SMULLT z11.s, z2.h, z1.h\n22\n23 .L_FIR_inner_loop:\n24 LD1H z2.h, p4/z, [xPtr, x6, LSL #1]\n25 // contiguous load of input data\n26 LD1RH z1.h, p5/z, [x8]\n27 // load with broadcast of one FIR filter coefficient\n28 ADD x6, x6, #1\n29 ADD x8, x8, #2\n30 SMLALB z10.s, z2.h, z1.h\n31 SMLALT z11.s, z2.h, z1.h\n32 CMP x8, taps\n33 B.MI .L_FIR_inner_loop\n34\n35 SQSHRNB z10.h, z10.s, #16\n36 SQSHRNT z10.h, z11.s, #16\n37 ST1H z10.h, p4, [yPtr]\n38 INCB yPtr\n39 ADDVL xPtr, xPtr, #1</pre>",

At line 10 the instruction HISTCNT provides the repetition information of currently processed image pixels, and according to this the relevant histogram values are updated in the memory by the scatter store instruction (line 12).</p><p>The gather load (line 9) and scatter store (line 12) instructions are significantly more expensive in terms of the execution time than contiguous vector load and store instructions. Therefore, these instructions considerably slow down the loop (lines 7-15) execution.</p><p>If high-performance is of greater interest than a vector length agnostic implementation, one can choose to implement 8-bit pixels histogram computation in vector length specific manner, avoiding the inefficient gather load and scatter store instructions. The latter is one implementation of that kind, where temporary counters of all histogram entries are kept in registers. For 8-bit image pixels there are 256 histogram entries, and therefore 256 temporary counters to maintain. The temporary counters are monitored. When at least one of the counters reaches its limit, the histogram values are updated by the current temporary counters and dumped back to the memory. The temporary counters are then reset to zero. The process is repeated until the whole image is screened.</p><p>The following is 512-bit vector length specific SVE2 implementation with limitation that nb_records must be multiple of 64. If image size is not multiple of 64, the rest of pixels is processed in the C scalar loop.</p><pre>1     MOV      w2, w2\n2     PTRUE    p0.b\n3     DUP      z29.b, #191      // histogram overflow guard: 255-4*16\n4\n5     CBZ      w2, .L_return\n6\n7     // Initialize histogram entries 0..255\n8     INDEX    z10.b, #0, #1      // z10: 0..63\n9     MOVPRFX  z11, z10\n10    ADD      z11.b, z11.b, #64\n11    MOVPRFX  z12, z10\n12    ADD      z12.b, z12.b, #128\n13    MOVPRFX  z13, z10\n14    ADD      z13.b, z13.b, #192  // z13: 192..255\n15</pre>",

Then, each group of 16 pixels is compared versus all 256 histogram entries by <code>HISTSEG</code> instructions. To produce the count of matches versus all 256 histogram entries four <code>HISTSEG</code> instructions are needed. For example, for the first group of 16 pixels these are <code>HISTSEG</code> instructions at lines 30-33. This is followed by the update of 256 temporary counters at lines 51-70.
