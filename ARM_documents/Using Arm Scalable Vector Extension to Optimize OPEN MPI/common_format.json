INTRODUCTION</h2><p>The need to satisfy the scientific computing community's increasing computational demands lead to larger HPC systems with more complex architectures, which provides more opportunities to enrich multiple levels of parallelism. One of the opportunities is to exploit data-level parallelism by code vectorization [1], and this causes the HPC systems to equip with vector processors. Comparing to scalar processors, vector processors support Single Instruction Multiple Data [2] (SIMD) Instruction Set Architectures and operate on one-dimensional arrays (vectors) rather than single elements. There are efforts to keep improving the vector processors by increasing the vector length and adding new vector instructions. Intel Knights Landing [3] introduced the Advanced Vector Extensions instruction set, AVX-512, which provides 512-bits-wide vector instructions and more vector registers; and Arm announced new Armv8 architecture embraced SVE together</p><p>with extension instruction sets.</p><p>SVE is a vector extension for AArch64 execution mode for the A64 instruction set of the Armv8 architecture [4], [5]. Unlike other SIMD architectures, SVE does not define the size of the vector registers, instead it provides a range of different values which permit vector code to adapt automatically to the current vector length at runtime with the feature of <i>Vector Length Agnostic</i> (VLA) programming [6], [7]. Vector length constrains in the range from a minimum of 128 bits up to a maximum of 2048 bits in increments of 128 bits.</p><p>SVE not only takes advantage of using long vectors but also enables powerful high vectorization features that can achieve significant speedup. Those features include but not limited to:</p><ol><li>using rich addressing mode which enables non-linear data access that can deal with non-contiguous data;</li><li>providing a valuable set of horizontal reduction operations which applies to more types of reducible loop carried dependencies including both logical, integer and floating-point reductions;</li><li>and permitting vectorization of loops with more complex loop carried dependencies and more complex control flow.</li></ol><p>Those extensions largely expand the usages of Arm architecture and increase opportunities for vector processing; as a result, HPC platforms and software can benefit significantly from SVE features.</p><p>Message Passing Interface (MPI) [8] is a popular and efficient parallel programming model for distributed memory systems widely used in scientific applications. As many scientific applications operate on multi-dimensional data, manipulating these data becomes complicated because the underlying memory layout is not contiguous. The MPI standard proposes a rich set of interfaces to define regular and irregular memory patterns, the so called Derived Datatypes (DDT).</p><p>DDT provides excellent functionality and flexibility by allowing the programmer to create arbitrary (contiguous and non-contiguous) structures from the MPI primitive datatypes. It is also useful for constructing messages that contain values with different datatypes and sending non-contiguous data (sub-matrix and matrix with irregular shape [9]) which eliminates the overhead of sending and receiving multiple small messages</p>",

One of the opportunities is to exploit data-level parallelism by code vectorization [1], and this causes the HPC systems to equip with vector processors. Comparing to scalar processors, vector processors support Single Instruction Multiple Data [2] (SIMD) Instruction Set Architectures and operate on one-dimensional arrays (vectors) rather than single elements. There are efforts to keep improving the vector processors by increasing the vector length and adding new vector instructions. Intel Knights Landing [3] introduced the Advanced Vector Extensions instruction set, AVX-512, which provides 512-bits-wide vector instructions and more vector registers; and Arm announced new Armv8 architecture embraced SVE together</p>",

With DDT, MPI datatype engine automatically packs and unpacks data based on the datatype; which is convenient for the user since it hides the low-level details. However, the cost of packing and unpacking in the datatype engine is high; to reduce this cost, MPI implementations need to design more powerful and efficient pack and unpack strategies. We contribute our efforts to investigate and improve the performance of datatype pack and unpack.</p><p>Computation-oriented collective operations like MPI_Reduce perform reductions on data along with the communications performed by collectives. These collectives typically require intensive CPU compute resources, which force the computation to become the bottleneck and limit its performance. However, with the presence of advanced architecture technologies introduced with wide vector extension and specialized arithmetic operations, it calls for MPI libraries to provide state-of-the-art design for advanced vector extension (SVE and AVX [3], [10]) based versions.

RELATED WORK</h2><p>In this section, we survey related work on techniques taking advantage of advanced hardware or architectures. Petrogalli [11] gives instructions on how SVE can be used to replace and optimize some commonly used general C functions. In a later work [12], it explores the usage of SVE vector multiple instruction to optimize matrix multiplication in machine learning such as GEMM algorithm. In another work [13], they leverage the characteristics of SVE to implement and optimize stencil computations, ubiquitous in scientific computing, which shows that SVE enables easy deployment of optimizations like loop unrolling, loop fusion, load trading or data reuse. However, all those work focus on using SVE for a specific application. In our work we study SVE enabled features in a more comprehensive way, and also provides detailed analysis about the efficiency achievements of using SVE instructions. We are focusing on networking runtime and not generic compute bound applications.</p><p>There have been several efforts to use similar techniques to improve MPI communication by optimizing pack and unpack procedure. Wu et al. [14] proposed GPU datatype engine which offloads the pack and unpack work to GPU in order to take advantage of GPU's parallel capability to provide high efficiency in-GPU pack and unpack. This work [15] presented a new zero-copy scheme to efficiently implement datatype communication over InfiniBand scatter gather work to optimize non-contiguous point to point communication. Mellanox's InfiniBand [16] explored the use of hardware scatter gather capabilities to eliminate CPU memory copies selectively, and offload handling data scatter and gather to the supported Host Channel Adapter. This capability is used to optimize small data all-to-all collective. Dosanjh et al. [17] took advantage of using AVX vector operation for MPI message matching to accelerate matches which demonstrated the efficiency of long vectors. We expand our investigation of SVE capabilities to optimize MPI from different aspects directly at processor instruction level which is more straightforward and without the need for external or extra hardware compared to previous work [14], [16].</p><p>Additionally, different techniques and efforts have been</p>",

Jesper [18] proposed a simple implementation of MPI library internal functionality that enables MPI reduction operations to be performed more efficiently with increasing sparsity of the input vectors. Also [19], [20] provided design and implementation of computed-oriented collective using GPU accelerators. Luo [20] afforded the reduction operations to the GPU asynchronously by using multiple CUDA streams which allowed the overlap of communications and reduction operations. Michael [21] presented a pipeline algorithm for MPI Reduce that used a Run Length Encoding scheme to improve the global reduction of sparse floating-point data. Compared to those work, our SVE arithmetic reduction optimization is more general which has no limitation of data representation and is using CPU resources only.</p><h2>III. ARM SVE OVERVIEW</h2><p>Remarkable features of SVE includes: (1) Support for scalable vector and predicate registers, which together deliver a set of instructions that operate on wide vectors and predicates, and extend efficient vectorization to even broader scope with more control operation for active elements only. (2) VLA allows the same SVE code to run on platforms using different vector lengths with no need to modify or recompile the code. This feature provides high portability of software in the space of various combinations of hardware and software stacks to embrace massive parallelism as well as a deeper and more complex component hierarchy to continue the growth in compute capabilities. (3) Gather load and scatter store strengthen the capabilities to selectively transfer non-contiguous data, resulting in better performing pack and unpack algorithms which can dramatically reduce the number of memory copies for non-contiguous data.</p><h3>A. Arm Intrinsic Instructions</h3><p>Intrinsics are C or C++ pseudo-function calls that the compiler replaces with the appropriate SIMD instructions. The Arm C language extensions (ACLE) [22] for SVE provide a set of types, accessors and intrinsic functions that a C and C++ compiler can directly convert into SVE assembly. It provides function-to-instruction mapping of SVE vectors and predicates, and function interfaces for relevant SVE vectorization instructions. It enables high level language user to explicitly use the datatypes and operations available in the Arm SVE ISA. Our SVE enabled optimized implementation is written in ACLE.</p><h3>B. Arm Instruction Emulator and Gem5</h3><p>SVE vector instruction extension offers many opportunities to optimize memory access and compute workloads, but with the availability of SVE-enabled hardware is not publicly available, we have rely on simulation techniques in order to evaluate our implementations.</p><p>ARMIE [23] is a tool that converts instructions not supported by hardware to native Armv8-A instructions, such as those from the SVE instruction set. ARMIE enables developers to run SVE executable on existing Armv8-A hardware paired with dynamic binary instrumentation, enabling full</p><p>application tracing without the overhead found in simulators. ARMIE includes an emulation client for SVE and optional instrumentation clients (e.g., Instruction count client emulated SVE, Opcode Count), which communicate between each other using the emulator API. Details about ARMIE's capability are not in the scope of this paper, but we still want to mention the feature of collecting dynamic characteristics and metrics from the executing application, such as memory traces and instruction counts, allowing a more in-depth and more insightful analysis. ARMIE is not capable of producing timing information and incurs an emulation and binary instrumentation overhead on the running application. However, we can use instruction counts to measure how many actual instructions are executed during the execution of applications which includes the total number of instructions and the number of emulated SVE instructions. This feature will be a key method to evaluate the performance of our implementation in this paper.</p><p>Gem5 [24], [25] simulator is an open source modular platform for computer-system architecture research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor microarchitecture. Gem5 has multiple execution modes, such as an atomic mode in which an instruction level simulation is performed, and an O3 mode in which an accurate execution cycle number can be estimated by simulating an out-of-order pipeline. In addition, Gem5 supports many existing processor architectures such as Alpha, Arm, SPARC and x86. For the interests of this paper, Gem5 can model up to 64 heterogeneous cores of an Arm platform, and Arm implementation supports 32 or 64-bit kernels and applications. It provides support for modeling Arm SVE instructions which decouple SVE ISA semantics from its CPU models, enabling effective support of SVE instruction and providing cycle-accurate counts for those instructions. Gem5 has a full system mode and a system emulation mode. Under system emulation mode, memory management and system calls are executed as services in Gem5. Gem5 provides statistical information of accurate cycle counts which is not available using ARMIE. In our work, we investigate using both methods to get instruction count and cycle count.</p><h2>IV. OPEN MPI OPERATION WITH SVE</h2><p>A. SVE rich memory access addressing for pack and unpack</p><p>SVE vector load and store instructions transfer data in memory to or from elements of one or more vector or predicate transfer registers. It provides several types of instruction that can be used to optimize memory operations as:</p><ol><li>Predicted single vector contiguous element accesses load and store (ld1 and st1).</li><li>Predicted multiple vector contiguous structure load and store (ldNx and stNx, N = 2,3,4).</li><li>Predicted non-contiguous element accesses Gather Load and Scatter Store.</li></ol><h3>1) Contiguous memory layout</h3><p>Memory copy is the most widely used memory operation. C standard library provides function as memcpy, and with the help of modern compiler it is converted to assembly code</p>",

ARMIE is not capable of producing timing information and incurs an emulation and binary instrumentation overhead on the running application.

For the interests of this paper, Gem5 can model up to 64 heterogeneous cores of an Arm platform, and Arm implementation supports 32 or 64-bit kernels and applications. It provides support for modeling Arm SVE instructions which decouple SVE ISA semantics from its CPU models, enabling effective support of SVE instruction and providing cycle-accurate counts for those instructions. Gem5 has a full system mode and a system emulation mode. Under system emulation mode, memory management and system calls are executed as services in Gem5.

Existing architecture using vectors which can copy 64 or 128 bits depending on vector length related to specific architecture. But with Arm SVE the maximum vector length we can apply is 2048 bits. SVE vector load and store work efficiently when copying large contiguous data or non-contiguous data with large block length. SVE also provides more parallel memory copy operation by which single instruction using multiple vector for load and store, such as</p><pre>svint8x4_t svld4(svbool_t pg, const int8_t * base)</pre><p>which interprets a single instruction uses four vectors loading data simultaneously.</p><h3>2) Non-Contiguous memory layout</h3><p>For non-contiguous datatype layouts as shown in Figure 1, vector type Fig 1(a) is the most regular and certainly the most widely used MPI datatype constructor. Vector allows replication of a datatype into locations that consist of equally spaced blocks, describing the data layout by using block-length, stride and count. <b>Block-length</b> refers to the number of primitive datatypes that a block contains, <b>stride</b> refers to the number of primitive datatypes between blocks, and <b>count</b> defines the number of blocks needs to be processed. A distinctive flavor of vector datatype, frequently used in computational sciences and machine learning, access a single column of matrix as presented in Fig 1(c) and can be represented by a specialized vector type with block-length equal one.</p><p>Datatypes other than vector exposes less and less regularity and neither the size of each block nor the displacements between successive blocks are constant. In order of growing complexity, MPI supports INDEXED, BLOCK (constant block-length different displacements), INDEXED (different block-lengths and different displacements), and finally STRUCT (different block-lengths, different displacements and different composing datatypes). Such datatypes Fig 1(b) cannot be described in a concise format using only block-length and stride.</p><p>Vector loads and stores of most processors can only access elements stored in consecutive locations. Thus, for non-contiguous data either issue loads and stores for each block using one register, or possibly issue several scalar load and store operations to load/store a vector register and then execute in vector mode, the resulting vector code obtains low speedups, or even slowdowns, with respect to its scalar counterpart. However SVE introduces new subsets of instruction that provides multiple addressing access mode to enable gather load and scatter store for non-contiguous memory. There are two kinds of addressing that have the same format with a base component with a displacement component: <i>vector plus immediate</i> and <i>scalar plus vector</i>. The base is the start point of source data, and the displacement represents offsets of all primitive data by a common offset described by an immediate value from the base address in each element of the vector register. In <i>scalar plus vector</i> addressing, it points to the</p><p>memory that is separated from common base register by the offset in each element of the offsets vector with an option to shift the offset according to the element size to be loaded.</p><p>In our case, we use <i>scalar plus vector</i> of offsets mode, with a specified explanation as</p><pre>svint32_t svld1_gather_s32base_of_fset_s32(svbool_t pg,<br/>svuint32_t bases, int64_t of fset)</pre><p>is a gather load (ld1_gather) of signed 32-bit integer (<math>\\text{_{s32}}</math>) from a vector of unsigned 32-bit integer base addresses (<math>\\text{_{u32base}}</math>) plus an offset in bytes (<math>\\text{_{offset}}</math>). We develop an optimized pack and unpack algorithm specialized for a vector-like datatype. Gather load and scatter store processes multiple non-contiguous small blocks simultaneously instead of using a for loop copy block by block. Gather load and scatter store is ideal for pack and unpack of derived regular vector type, we generate the offsets vector once based on block length and gaps then it can be repeatedly used. We can visualize that for less regular memory it may have a repeating pattern of memory layout, thus if we can generate offset vectors for the repeat pattern then we can apply multiple gather loads and scatter stores for each repetition and apply to all repetitions.</p><p>For column access pattern, SVE has a special instruction to generate offsets vector for this particular need as:</p><pre>svint32_t svindex_s32(int32_t base, int32_t step)</pre><p>with pattern <math>\\{\\text{base}, \\text{base} + \\text{step}, \\text{base} + \\text{step} \\times 2, \\dots\\}</math>. With gather load and scatter store, users can copy a whole vector of data which is much more efficient compared to cherry picking a single element per vector. To summarize, gather load and scatter store can efficiently pack and unpack non-contiguous data by generating reasonable offsets vector or vectors. Due to the space constraints, we focus our efforts on regular vector type in the rest of this paper.</p><h3>B. Reduction operation</h3><p>A reduction is a typical operation found in many scientific applications. Those applications have large amounts of data level parallelism and should be able to benefit from SIMD support for reduction operation. Traditional reduction operation performs element by element of the input buffer which executes as a sequential operation, or it is probably could be vectorized under a particular circumstance. Sometimes it may suffer from dependencies across multiple loop iterations. SVE reduction instructions perform arithmetic horizontally across active elements of a single source vector and deliver a scalar result. SVE provides arithmetic reduction operation for integer and float-pointing, also supports logical reduction operations for integer type, an example format would be</p><pre>svint32_t svmul_s32(svbool_t pg, svint32_t op1,<br/>svint32_t op2)</pre><p>this function produces the product results of two vectors. This gives the chance to create Arm intrinsic reduction in MPI, which will highly increase the parallelization and performance</p>",

We implemented several micro benchmarks using ACLE to compare with extracted related kernel code from OPEN MPI. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of customized ACLE memory copy algorithms for both contiguous memory and non-contiguous vector type. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of SVE vector-based reduction operations. All experiments are conducted under the same experimental setting. We present the average and standard deviation of 30 times (which is too small to be noticeable). For the</p><p>configuration, we use: <i>Arm HPC compiler 19.2</i> with <i>gcc 8.2.0</i>, compiled with <i>-O3</i> and <i>-march=armv8-a+sve</i> option by which will trigger automatic vectorization that targets SVE VLA techniques. It supports auto-vectorization for SVE as well as in-line assembly. For SVE instruction simulator and instruction clients, we use <i>ARMIE version 19.1</i>. For Gem5 we use Arm's internal version (corresponding upstream is gem5/sve/beta1) which has SVE enabled support. Furthermore, under <i>-O3</i> mode, the memory access instruction is divided into the processing of generating the cache request and the processing after receiving the data from the cache. This means that the Gem5 simulated results represent the complete data fetching operation instead of just issuing the cache request. Table 1 summarizes some of the notations we will employ to describe the algorithms and performance analysis. Equation 1 describes how we calculate the instruction count for all experiments, in order to evaluate and strengthen the number of instructions executed of the target code section, we need to eliminate the baseline - the number of instructions executed besides the target code (e.g. initialize and finalize). The baseline is calculated by running the same test codes but no data being processed.</p><h4>1) Contiguous memory</h4><p>For contiguous large data buffer, our ACLE customized memory copy implementation adapts two features of SVE. It not only adapts the usage of using long scalable vector for load and store which can copy more data compared to normal data register, but also uses four SVE vectors instead of single vector which highly reduces the number of control instructions. List 1 shows the code snippet comparison of memcpy and our ACLE optimized memory copy algorithm together with related assemble code. We can see that for memcpy method it is using <math>z0</math> for load and store. For ACLE method it uses <math>z0 \\sim z3</math> vectors for load and store. Those two methods have the same total amount of assembly code, and ACLE method copy four times of the data more than memcpy which highly decreases the number of total instructions. Also it needs less control and branching instructions, which will be reflected to performance gain.</p><p><math display=\"block\">\\text{Instruction\\_count} = (\\text{Actual} - \\text{Base}) \\quad (1)</math></p><p>Actual: when dealing with <math>\\text{number\\_of\\_elements} &gt; 0</math><br/>Base: when dealing with <math>\\text{number\\_of\\_elements} = 0</math></p>",

It supports auto-vectorization for SVE as well as in-line assembly. For SVE instruction simulator and instruction clients, we use <i>ARMIE version 19.1</i>. For Gem5 we use Arm's internal version (corresponding upstream is gem5/sve/beta1) which has SVE enabled support. Furthermore, under <i>-O3</i> mode, the memory access instruction is divided into the processing of generating the cache request and the processing after receiving the data from the cache. This means that the Gem5 simulated results represent the complete data fetching operation instead of just issuing the cache request. Table 1 summarizes some of the notations we will employ to describe the algorithms and performance analysis. Equation 1 describes how we calculate the instruction count for all experiments, in order to evaluate and strengthen the number of instructions executed of the target code section, we need to eliminate the baseline - the number of instructions executed besides the target code (e.g. initialize and finalize). The baseline is calculated by running the same test codes but no data being processed.</p>",

Experiments are conducted with different vector length varies from 128 to 2048 bits for both memcpy and ACLE implementation copying 1MB data. We can see that for both cases the instruction count shows a linear decrease when VL increases, which demonstrate the efficiency of Arm SVE long vector. Also the total number of instructions executed by memcp is 400% of ACLE, which shows a consistent behavior as the assembly code and illustrates using multiples vectors for load and store will highly decrease the number of instructions. The only exception is that when <math>VL = 128</math> bits memcp uses advanced SIMD instead of SVE vector, which demonstrates that by implicitly using ACLE intrinsic, it helps the compiler to optimize code assembling better.</p><p>Figure 3 displays the comparison results of Gem5 accurately simulated cycles of both methods. The size of the L1 cache is set to 32 Kbytes with 4 ways and the size of the L2 cache is set to 2 Mbytes with 16 ways. One load and one store operation are available in a cycle. Continuous load and store instructions access to the L1 cache by the vector length in a cycle. For both methods, the configuration uses the same number of physical registers. Copying the same amount of data, for both cases, it needs to create equal amounts of load and store requests. But for our ACLE customized method it largely reduced the number of control and branching instructions, which results in a performance gain of 5% as shown in the figure, when <math>VL = 128</math> ACLE is 25% faster than memcp which strengthens that this SVE instruction is more efficient than general instruction.</p><h4>2) Non-Contiguous memory</h4><p>The support of SVE instruction-level gather load and scatter store addressing capabilities provides a mechanism for defining new memory operation for non-contiguous memory (e.g. for sparse linear algebra operations), which can potentially deal with multiple small gapped memory pieces or indexed elements simultaneously based on the length of SVE vector. As such, multiple memory copies can be compressed as a single copy.

Several experiments were performed. The source data is non-contiguous but with a regular pattern as vector type and destination is contiguous. The same as above, we compare the performance of memcp and ACLE code with different VL.</p><p>Figure 4 shows the instruction counts when copy 1MB non-contiguous data with <math>blocklen = 1</math> and <math>gap = 1</math>. We can see that memcp implementation cannot take advantage of using different vector length, and the amounts of instruction counts of different VL stay the same which is limited by the fact of copying block by block in the loop. However, the ACLE code takes the optimization of using SVE long vector and also gather load and scatter store feature which copies more data per instruction. It shows the decrease of instruction counts start from <math>10\\times</math> to <math>100\\times</math> as the VL increases compared to the non-optimized implementation. Also it shows a linear decrease with the vector length increases which proves that the load and store instruction fully fills the vector register. Also for ACLE method the ratio of SVE instruction compared to the total instruction is higher than memcp method.</p><p>Figure 5 illustrates the Gem5 simulated cycle results for both methods when packing and unpacking non-contiguous data. We can see that with the same configuration ACLE gather and scatter implementation is faster than memcp under all VL settings and shows a speedup of 15% to 20%. Compared to the decrease of instruction counts the simulated cycles are not significant; it is because the SVE supported implementation in Gem5 is not quite efficient. We believe with actual hardware, the clock cycles of gather and scatter instruction will be further reduced. Thus, we can see that by using Arm SVE instruction, our optimized ACLE memory copy algorithms provide good performance results for both contiguous and non-contiguous memory layout.</p><h3>D.

Experiments are conducted with different vector length varies from 128 to 2048 bits for both memcpy and ACLE implementation copying 1MB data. We can see that for both cases the instruction count shows a linear decrease when VL increases, which demonstrate the efficiency of Arm SVE long vector. Also the total number of instructions executed by memcp is 400% of ACLE, which shows a consistent behavior as the assembly code and illustrates using multiples vectors for load and store will highly decrease the number of instructions. The only exception is that when <math>VL = 128</math> bits memcp uses advanced SIMD instead of SVE vector, which demonstrates that by implicitly using ACLE intrinsic, it helps the compiler to optimize code assembling better.</p>",

The size of the L1 cache is set to 32 Kbytes with 4 ways and the size of the L2 cache is set to 2 Mbytes with 16 ways. One load and one store operation are available in a cycle. Continuous load and store instructions access to the L1 cache by the vector length in a cycle. For both methods, the configuration uses the same number of physical registers. Copying the same amount of data, for both cases, it needs to create equal amounts of load and store requests. But for our ACLE customized method it largely reduced the number of control and branching instructions, which results in a performance gain of 5% as shown in the figure, when <math>VL = 128</math> ACLE is 25% faster than memcp which strengthens that this SVE instruction is more efficient than general instruction.</p>",

We can see that memcp implementation cannot take advantage of using different vector length, and the amounts of instruction counts of different VL stay the same which is limited by the fact of copying block by block in the loop. However, the ACLE code takes the optimization of using SVE long vector and also gather load and scatter store feature which copies more data per instruction. It shows the decrease of instruction counts start from <math>10\\times</math> to <math>100\\times</math> as the VL increases compared to the non-optimized implementation. Also it shows a linear decrease with the vector length increases which proves that the load and store instruction fully fills the vector register.

We can see that with the same configuration ACLE gather and scatter implementation is faster than memcp under all VL settings and shows a speedup of 15% to 20%. Compared to the decrease of instruction counts the simulated cycles are not significant; it is because the SVE supported implementation in Gem5 is not quite efficient. We believe with actual hardware, the clock cycles of gather and scatter instruction will be further reduced. Thus, we can see that by using Arm SVE instruction, our optimized ACLE memory copy algorithms provide good performance results for both contiguous and non-contiguous memory layout.</p>",

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION IN OPEN MPI</h2><p>We implemented our SVE optimization work in a set of components in OPEN MPI. While a full depiction of the architecture and feature set of OPEN MPI is out of the scope of this paper, some are relevant to our implementation effort. OPEN MPI is based on a Modular Component Architecture [26] which permits easily extending or substituting the core subsystem with experimental features. As shown in figure 8, within this architecture, each of the major subsystems is defined as an MCA framework, with a well-defined interface, and multiple components implementing that framework can coexist.</p><p>We added our SVE optimization work in two components to OPEN MPI architecture. The SVE Pack Unpack related component is in charge of using the high parallelization ACLE memory copy service mentioned in section IV-C. The improvement includes the optimization for pack and unpack with both contiguous data using four SVE vectors to load and store simultaneous, also taking advantage of gather load and scatter store instructions for non-contiguous small block data as revealed in algorithm 1. The Arm_SVE_OF component implements several reduction operations (eg, max, sum, prod) with Arm SVE vector reduction instructions; to be noted, this component can be extended out the scope of local reduction to general mathematics and logic operations.

          "html": "<p>Figure 6 shows the instruction counts by using ARMIE for both cases with buffer size 4MB processing float point data. We can see for both methods that with <math>V.L = 128</math> bits the instruction count is 16x compared to <math>V.L = 2048</math> bits, which demonstrates the efficiency of SVE long vector. Also by implicitly using ACLE vector instruction the instruction count is only 66% by using C with element-wise operation. With O3 option, vectorizing compiler that automatically translates sequences of scalar operations, represented in the form of loops, into vector instructions which substitute element-wise operation to a vector version behavior. Our ACLE using intrinsics which gives us complete control of the low-level details at the expense of productivity and portability. Figure 7 shows the accurate execution cycles of the two experiments with Gem5 results. We can see that with the same configuration ACLE implementation is 30% faster. And it shows a linear decrease with vector length increase. Similar investigations are conducted for other reduction operations, including but not limited to SUM, PROD, and logical operation BXOR which show a similar performance benefit.</p>",

EVALUATION USING ARMIE</h2><p>In this section, we discuss our experimental setup. We experimented on Arm HPC system which is a ThunderX2-based server running at 2 GHz. Our work is based upon OPEN MPI master branch, revision #75a539. Each experiment is repeated 30 times, and we present the average. For all experiment we</p><p>use a single node with one process, because our optimization aims to improve the performance of local operation for all processes either with pack unpack or reduction. We compile and install OPEN MPI using Arm HPC compile 19.2 with flag \"-march=armv8-a+sve\". Without SVE supported publicly available hardware at the moment, we use ARMIE to evaluate the performance of our optimization. Instead of presenting the time to completion of the different benchmarks, we rely upon instead on the number of instructions to be executed, a metric that correctly highlights the performance implications.</p><p>We evaluate the performance of our packing and unpacking SVE optimization methodology using MPI datatype benchmark in OPEN MPI code base. We present here the results using non-contiguous memory layout vector type created by MPI_Type_vector with <i>blocklen</i> = 1 and <i>gap</i> = 1, repetition 2048 to make sure the data can fully fill SVE vector even with <i>VL</i> = 2048 bits. For message size we use 1MB. In order to eliminate the unnecessary communication between processes and focus on our local pack and unpack optimization we intentionally use one process to send to itself by MPI_Send and MPI_Recv functions.</p><p>Figure 9 shows the comparison benchmark results using OPEN MPI and SVE optimized OPEN MPI. Experiments are conducted with <i>VL</i> = 256 to <i>VL</i> = 2048 bits. For <i>VL</i> = 128 bits our implementation doesn't use gather and scatter feature due to limited benefit. We can see that for OPEN MPI with different vector length it shows a constant number of instruction count which cannot take advantage of the long vector extension. For SVE optimized implementation the instruction count is 16% less starting with <i>VL</i> = 256 bits, which dramatically decreases as vector length increases because we optimized to use full vector for load and store. With <i>VL</i> = 2048 bits it is almost 10\u00d7 less.</p><p>For the reduction benchmark we use the MPI_Reduce_local function call to perform the local reduction for all supported MPI operations using an array of 4M bytes. Figure 10 shows the result for the (MPI_MAX) reduction, but we have observed a similar outcome for all the other reduction operations. First, it should be noted that the compiler, despite the optimization flags provided, did not generate auto-vectorized code for the default OPEN MPI, leading to a number of instruction constant, directly related to the number of elements in the input array. As our code explicitly uses theACLE intrinsic vector reduction instruction, the reduction in the number of instructions is directly proportional to the vector lengths on which the instructions operate. Thus, with <i>VL</i> = 128 bits it reduces instruction count by 50%, when vector length reaches 2048 bits, the instruction count is reduced by a factor of 30, a clear indicator of a more concise generated code and potentially of shorter execution time.</p><h2>VII. EVALUATION ON SVE ENABLED HARDWARE A64FX</h2><p>We evaluate our implementation on a cluster with Fujitsu's Arm SVE based processor A64FX, which is the first processor of the Armv8-A SVE architecture and used for the post-K computer targeting HPC and AI applications. Each processor</p>",

Figure 10 shows the result for the (MPI_MAX) reduction, but we have observed a similar outcome for all the other reduction operations. First, it should be noted that the compiler, despite the optimization flags provided, did not generate auto-vectorized code for the default OPEN MPI, leading to a number of instruction constant, directly related to the number of elements in the input array. As our code explicitly uses theACLE intrinsic vector reduction instruction, the reduction in the number of instructions is directly proportional to the vector lengths on which the instructions operate. Thus, with <i>VL</i> = 128 bits it reduces instruction count by 50%, when vector length reaches 2048 bits, the instruction count is reduced by a factor of 30, a clear indicator of a more concise generated code and potentially of shorter execution time.</p>",

For the experiments, we flushed cache in order to make sure we are not reusing cache for a fair comparison. Our results demonstrate that with SVE-enabled operation it is 4<math>\\times</math> faster than element-wise operation. We also compare MPI operation performance together with memcpy which indicates the peak memory bandwidth. For MPI reduction operation it needs <math>2\\text{loads} + 1\\text{store} + \\text{computation}</math>, for memcpy it only needs <math>1\\text{load} + 1\\text{store}</math>. It shows that even with computation included our SVE reduction operation achieves a similar level of memory bandwidth as memcpy.</p><h2>VIII. CONCLUSION</h2><p>In this paper, we demonstrated the benefits of Arm SVE vector operations. We addressed the performance advantages of different features introduced by SVE with multiple vector lengths compared to non-SVE implementations. Furthermore, we extended the implementation of our investigation and analysis to introduced an optimistic MPI optimization from two aspects. For our first optimization, we adapted SVE rich memory address feature to improve the pack and unpack operations for regular MPI datatype. We use multiple vectors to simultaneously load and stores large contiguous memory</p><img alt=\"Figure 12: Comparison of MPI local reduction together with MEMCPY for V.L. = 512 bits on A64FX processor.

For our first optimization, we adapted SVE rich memory address feature to improve the pack and unpack operations for regular MPI datatype.

We use ARMIE to simulate and calculate the actual number of instructions executed with MPI DDT benchmark. We reduced the instruction counts from 16% to 10X respectively depending on the vector instruction length. Also, we introduced a new reduction operation module in OPEN MPI using Arm SVE intrinsics supporting different kinds of MPI reduce operations for multiple MPI types. We demonstrated the efficiency of our vector reduction operation by a benchmark calling MPI_Local_reduce. From <math>VL = 128</math> to <math>VL = 2048</math> bits we decreased the instruction count from 50% to <math>30\\times</math>. To further validate the performance improvements, experiments are conducted using Fujitsu's A64FX processor. With our gather and scatter based pack and unpack the new algorithm is <math>2\\times</math> faster. For MPI_Local_reduce with <math>VL = 512</math> SVE based reduction operation is <math>4\\times</math> faster. Our analysis and implementation of OPEN MPI optimization provides useful insights and guidelines on how Arm SVE vector ISA can be used in actual high performance computing platforms and software to improve the efficiency of parallel runtimes and applications.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><ol><li>S.

We use ARMIE to simulate and calculate the actual number of instructions executed with MPI DDT benchmark. We reduced the instruction counts from 16% to 10X respectively depending on the vector instruction length. Also, we introduced a new reduction operation module in OPEN MPI using Arm SVE intrinsics supporting different kinds of MPI reduce operations for multiple MPI types. We demonstrated the efficiency of our vector reduction operation by a benchmark calling MPI_Local_reduce. From <math>VL = 128</math> to <math>VL = 2048</math> bits we decreased the instruction count from 50% to <math>30\\times</math>. To further validate the performance improvements, experiments are conducted using Fujitsu's A64FX processor. With our gather and scatter based pack and unpack the new algorithm is <math>2\\times</math> faster. For MPI_Local_reduce with <math>VL = 512</math> SVE based reduction operation is <math>4\\times</math> faster. Our analysis and implementation of OPEN MPI optimization provides useful insights and guidelines on how Arm SVE vector ISA can be used in actual high performance computing platforms and software to improve the efficiency of parallel runtimes and applications.</p>",
