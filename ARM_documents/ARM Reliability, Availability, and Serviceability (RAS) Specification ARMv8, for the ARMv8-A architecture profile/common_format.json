A detected uncorrected error is <i>containable</i> if it is not uncontainable. If the component cannot determine whether a detected error is uncontainable or containable, it must treat it as uncontainable.</p><p>An error that is uncontainable at a component might still be containable at the system level.</p><h5>Note</h5><p>Reporting an error as containable allows software to contain the error.

It is the responsibility of the error recovery and fault handling processes to collate the error record data and write it to an <i>error log</i>.

In other systems, a DC ZVA operation might also clear the error. However, the Protection granule might be larger than the DC ZVA block size and/or the largest single-copy atomic access that the PE can perform. These systems might require software to stop using the Protection granule, for example by not using the physical page containing the granule, until the system can be purged of errors, for example at a system reset. The architecture does not set any limit on the size of a Protection granule and it might be larger than a translation granule. Any mechanism for purging the system of errors is also IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.</p><h3>2.1.2 Error correction and deferment</h3><p>If hardware can correct or defer a detected error, it must do so.

If the error cannot be isolated, the system must be shut down to avoid catastrophic failure.</li></ul><p>The following two sections list additional sub-types.</p><p>This taxonomy is shown by Figure 2.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"dc8d4323c2d4a62089422b77927e9e00_img.jpg\"/><div class=\"img-description\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\"><p>Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating the Taxonomy of producer error types.</p><p>The flow starts with the question: <b>Silently propagated?</b></p><ul><li>If the answer is <b>no</b>, the flow proceeds to the question: <b>Error corrected?</b><ul><li>If the answer is <b>yes</b>, the error is <b>Corrected</b>.</li><li>If the answer is <b>no</b>, the flow proceeds to the question: <b>Error deferred?</b><ul><li>If the answer is <b>no</b>, the error is <b>Unrecoverable</b>.</li><li>If the answer is <b>yes</b>, the error is <b>Deferred</b>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>If the answer to <b>Silently propagated?</b> is <b>maybe</b>, the error is <b>Uncontainable</b>.</li></ul></div><p>Figure 2: Taxonomy of producer error types</p><h5>Additional subtypes for an Uncorrected error produced at the node</h5><p>For an error produced at the node, a node might additionally define the following subtypes:</p>",

It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the node fully disables error detection and correction when reporting and logging are disabled.</p><h4>Fault handling interrupt</h4><p>This is the asynchronous reporting of all or some detected errors by an interrupt, that is, all Corrected errors, Deferred errors, and Uncorrected errors.

Software might poll the error counter or initialize the counter with a threshold value and receive an interrupt when the counter overflows. A counter overflows when incrementing the counter results in unsigned integer overflow.</p><p>It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED which Corrected errors are counted.</p><p>It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED and might be UNPREDICTABLE whether Deferred and Uncorrected errors are counted by the Corrected error counter.</p><p>See also <a href=\"#\">Standard format Corrected error counter</a>.</p><h4>In-band Uncorrected error signaling (external aborts)</h4><p>This is the in-band signaling of detected Uncorrected errors to the consumer of the error.

ESB instruction executed at Non-secure EL1.</p><h4>Usage constraints</h4><p>Direct reads and writes of VDISR are <b>UNDEFINED</b> at EL1 and EL0 and, if EL3 is implemented and using AArch32, in:</p><ul><li>All Secure privileged modes other than Monitor mode.</li><li>Monitor mode when SCR.NS == 0.</li></ul><p>If HCR.AMO == 1, then direct reads and writes of <b>DISR</b> at Non-secure EL1 access VDISR.</p><p>An indirect write to VDISR made by an <b>ESB</b> instruction does not require an explicit synchronization operation for the value written to be observed by a direct read of <b>DISR</b> occurring in program order after the <b>ESB</b>.</p><h4>Traps and enables</h4><p>Subject to the exception prioritization rules:</p><ul><li>If EL2 is implemented and using AArch64, and HSTR.EL2.T12 == 1, then direct reads and writes of VDISR in Non-secure state at EL1 generate a Trap exception to EL2.</li><li>If EL2 is implemented and using AArch32, and HSTR.T12 == 1, then direct reads and writes of VDISR in Non-secure state at EL1 generate a Hyp Trap exception.</li></ul><h4>Configurations</h4><p>There is one instance of VDISR that is used in both Secure and Non-secure states.</p><p>Present only if all of the following apply:</p><ul><li>EL2 is implemented and using AArch32.</li><li>The RAS Extension is implemented.</li></ul><p>Direct reads and writes of VDISR are <b>UNDEFINED</b> otherwise.</p><p>If the highest implemented Exception level is using AArch64, VDISR is architecturally mapped to <b>VDISR_EL2</b>.</p><h4>Attributes</h4><p>VDISR is a 32-bit read/write AArch32 System register accessed using MRC and MCR of p15, 4, c12, c1, 1.</p><h4>Field descriptions</h4><p>When EL1 is using the Long-descriptor format, the VDISR bit assignments

The miscellaneous syndrome registers contain:</p><ul><li>Corrected error counter or counters, if the node supports the counting of Corrected errors.</li><li>Information to identify the FRU in which the error was detected, and might contain enough information to locate the error within that FRU.</li><li>Other state information not present in the corresponding status and address registers.</li></ul><p>If the node supports the architecturally-defined error counter, then it is implemented in ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0.</p><h4>Usage constraints</h4><p>Reads from ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0 return an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value and writes have IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED behavior. ARM recommends that miscellaneous syndrome for multiple errors, such as a corrected error counter, is read/write. This allows a counter to be reset in the presence of a persistent error. Miscellaneous syndrome for the most recently recorded error, such as information locating a FRU for that error, should ignore writes when <a href=\"#\">ERR&lt;n&gt;STATUS.MV</a> is set to 1. This prevents information being lost if an error is detected whilst the previous error is being logged.</p><h4>Configurations</h4><p>Always implemented.</p><h4>Attributes</h4><p>When accessed using System registers, ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0 is a 64-bit read/write register accessed using:</p><ul><li>MRC and MCR of <a href=\"#\">ERXMISC0</a> for ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0[31:0] when <a href=\"#\">ERRSELR.SEL</a> is set to n.</li><li>MRS and MSR of <a href=\"#\">ERXMISC0.EL1</a> when <a href=\"#\">ERRSELR.EL1.SEL</a> is set to n.</li><li>MRC and MCR of <a href=\"#\">ERXMISC1</a> for ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0[63:32] when <a href=\"#\">ERRSELR.SEL</a> is set to n.</li></ul><p>When accessed as a memory-mapped register, ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0 is a 64-bit read/write register located at offset <math>0 \\times 020 + 64 \\times n</math>.</p><h5>ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0 (contents are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED)</h5><p>The ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0 (contents are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED) bit assignments are:</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"2a735d162b47b05b00778606b9cb4944_img.jpg\"/><div class=\"img-description\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\"><p>Diagram illustrating the bit assignments for ERR&lt;n&gt;MISC0 (contents are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED).</p><p>The register is 64 bits wide, indexed from 63 (left) to 0 (right).</p><p>Bits 63:32 are labeled \"IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED\".</p><p>Bits 31:0 are labeled \"IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED\".</p></div><h5>Bits [63:0], when contents are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED</h5><p>IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED syndrome.
