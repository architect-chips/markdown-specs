Many instructions execute repeatedly with the same inputs, producing the same outputs, thus wasting resources in the process. Value reuse techniques memorize previous executions of instructions, blocks or traces which may be reused if they appear again with the same input contexts. Although trace reuse techniques show great potential for both performance and energy consumption improvement, they have not been studied yet in one of the most widely available computer architectures \u2014 the ARM architecture. In this paper, the main issues with reusing traces in instruction sets with conditional execution are revisited. Afterwards, the reuse potential in the benchmark suite MiBench is analyzed varying (i) how traces are generated, and (ii) the size of reuse tables. Our results show that a memoization table of 32 KiB allows to reuse 18.36% of the total instructions on average.</p><h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2><p>Every day, more complex applications are developed, demanding more powerful processors, causing computer designs to increase their complexity. Parallel to this, most of the systems are used for more than a single purpose, thus making development of dedicated hardware not feasible in most cases.</p><p>In this context, there is a potential for value reuse techniques. These techniques aim to increase performance of general purpose processors by reducing the number of executed instructions. Reuse techniques make use of value locality, which can be defined as the potential of predicting values of program execution at runtime [10]. Thus, predictability can be defined as:</p><ul><li>Temporal, when it relates to the probability of an execution to generate the same result as another one executed in a near time;</li><li>Spatial, which corresponds to the probability of an execution to generate a variation from an earlier one.</li></ul><p>Value locality can be explored during run time to avoid running again redundant tasks, exploiting the same spatial and temporal locality phenomena that allow caches to reduce average latency in memory hierarchies.</p><p>According to Gabbay [10], a large portion of many applications is composed by redundant and predictable computa-</p><p>tion. The exploration of reuse techniques on simulated MIPS processors reached speedups up to 1.28 [29]. Moreover, Tsai and Chen [41] exploited value locality as a way of reducing energy consumption on ARM processors. In this case, the execution redundancy is used in order to increase the number of instructions issued to the processor. Hence, it causes a smaller number of pipeline stalls and it also increases the IPC. They also reported 75% less energy consumption.</p><p>In order to allow reuse, an additional buffer is necessary near the processor. This buffer is used to store information about previous executions in order to compare them with future executions. Reuse also requires mechanisms to test the contexts and effectively reuse the instructions.</p><p>Considering the need for additional hardware to implement reuse mechanisms, many factors must be evaluated to ensure the viability of the technique. These factors relate primarily to the buffer format and policies for data storage. The structure of the additional hardware for a reuse mechanism must consider the characteristics of the architecture used, which include: instruction set, size and number of registers, forms of address and other specific factors to each architecture.</p><p>In this paper, we assess the potential of value reuse techniques at trace level on ARM processor, considering the characteristics of the instruction set and the behavior of execution on this architecture. A behavior analysis of the execution of the benchmark suite MiBench on the ARM architecture simulator Sim-Panalyzer was made to enable this work. From this analysis, this paper proposes a trace reuse strategy and its storage structure, which exposes the impact of limitations during the construction of traces and their effects when using buffers of different sizes. Finally, we present the potential of trace reuse techniques using the evaluated strategies.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Principles of Value Reuse are described in Section II. In Section III, a short overview of the main features of ARM processors and their main challenges for reuse are presented. Modifications to trace reuse in order to address ARM's peculiarities and the development environment are described in Section IV. Section V presents our results. Related work is discussed in</p>",

Many instructions execute repeatedly with the same inputs, producing the same outputs, thus wasting resources in the process. Value reuse techniques memorize previous executions of instructions, blocks or traces which may be reused if they appear again with the same input contexts. Although trace reuse techniques show great potential for both performance and energy consumption improvement, they have not been studied yet in one of the most widely available computer architectures \u2014 the ARM architecture. In this paper, the main issues with reusing traces in instruction sets with conditional execution are revisited. Afterwards, the reuse potential in the benchmark suite MiBench is analyzed varying (i) how traces are generated, and (ii) the size of reuse tables. Our results show that a memoization table of 32 KiB allows to reuse 18.36% of the total instructions on average.</p>",

VALUE REUSE</h2><p>Value Reuse is a technique that exploits execution redundancy by reusing recurring sequences of executions [11]. It is originally designed as a non-speculative technique, i.e., it reuses only known values without making predictions. As the execution of the computation happens, the inputs and outputs of instructions are stored in an indexed table for future access. When this computation is executed again, its inputs will be compared with the ones stored in the table. If they match, output values stored in the table are directly copied to the output registers. Thus, some pipeline stages are not used, which saves resources.</p><p>Figure 1 depicts how an instruction reuse mechanism may be attached to an instruction pipeline. The reuse test is done in parallel with instruction fetch so as to avoid slowing the original pipeline stages. Therefore, the addition of a reuse mechanism does not reduce the performance of the architecture, even if instructions are not reused.</p><img alt=\"Diagram showing a pipeline with a reuse mechanism. The pipeline stages are Fetch, Decode/Rename, Dispatch, Issue, Execute, and Commit. The PC feeds into the Fetch stage. A Reuse Buffer feeds into the Decode/Rename stage. A Reuse Test stage is shown below the Decode/Rename stage, connected to the PC path. If reused, the execution path bypasses the Decode/Rename, Dispatch, Issue, and Execute stages, and proceeds directly to Commit.\" src=\"8d2f4e036a5e0205a1ea3f0b3378f584_img.jpg\"/><div class=\"img-description\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\"><div class=\"img-alt\">Diagram showing a pipeline with a reuse mechanism.

Pipeline with reuse mechanism [29].</p><p>For every instruction in the reuse domain that is decoded, its inputs are compared with candidate instructions from a reuse table. If the inputs of an entry match the current values, its output may be written to the destination registers, thus collapsing dependencies and avoiding redundant execution. If there is no match, the instruction is not reused and continues its regular way in the pipeline.</p><p>In addition to the advantages related to the reduction of instructions executed, energy savings, and reduced runtime, it is possible to highlight [6], [39]:</p><ul><li>Results of executions are available earlier, which can anticipate the execution of dependent instructions;</li><li>Data dependencies are reduced because dependent instructions can be reused in parallel; and</li><li>Executions generated by a branch misprediction may be reused by future executions, instead of being discarded.</li></ul><p>Throughout the approaches employing value reuse techniques, the basic difference among them is the unit of reuse [16], which can be such as reuse of instructions, basic blocks, or traces. All these strategies try to minimize the costs caused by the additional hardware and to maximize the possibility of reuse.</p><p>Traces are dynamic sequences of executed instructions that may contain branches [7], [12], as shown in Figure 2. Regarding reuse, traces have an input and an output context. The input context holds values required by instructions, while</p><p>the output context stores the set of values generated by the execution of these instructions. To allow reuse, these contexts must be stored in buffers, or memoization tables, in order to represent the traces with potential to be reused.</p><p>Just as instruction reuse, traces must pass by a reuse test to determine whether reuse will be made or not. As the instructions are fetched, they are compared with instructions that form traces already stored in reuse buffer. Traces are considered redundant when their input contexts are equal. The approach of trace reuse allows several instructions to be reused at the same time, suppressing redundant sequences of executions.</p><img alt=\"Diagram illustrating trace construction.

THE ARM ARCHITECTURE</h2><p>The ARM architecture [37] is a category of superscalar RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors that aim for simplicity and low power consumption. These characteristics made these processors the market's reference for embedded computing and handheld devices. They are easily found on mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, calculators, on-board computers, printers, network equipment, etc. As a RISC architecture, it has the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>Large and uniform register file;</li><li>Load/store architecture, where operations occur only between registers, not directly in memory;</li><li>Simple addressing modes, with all load and store addresses determined by contents of registers and instruction parameters; and</li><li>Fixed and uniform instruction size.</li></ul><p>One of the main challenges in implementing reuse for ARM architectures is the feature of conditional execution of instructions. In the ARM instruction set [19], instructions can be conditionally executed (predicated). The execution is dependent on the state of conditional bits at run time. Inside the instructions, there are 4 bits that define 16 different conditions for an instruction to be executed, as shown in Table I. An instruction will be executed or not according to the state of these conditional bits of the CPSR (Current Program Status Register). If the corresponding bits on CPSR indicate that the</p>",

REUSING TRACES IN ARM ARCHITECTURES</h2><p>In order to analyze the behavior of programs running on the ARM architecture, experiments were performed with the benchmark suite MiBench on the Sim-Panalyzer simulator. Both are described in Section IV-A, while Section IV-B details the trace reuse mechanism proposed for the experiments.</p><h3>A. Development Environment</h3><p>The Sim-Panalyzer simulator [25] is a software used to simulate ARM architectures on general purpose computers. This tool was based on another simulator, named SimpleScalar [4], that is designed to simulate architectures such as x86, PISA, ARM and Alpha. The main objective of Sim-Panalyzer is to create a power estimator in order to evaluate power/performance tradeoffs. The simulator implements the ARMv7 instruction set [1] and the pipeline of a StrongArm processor [46]. Sim-Panalyzer\u2019s source code is also available, which was an important requirement for this work. More specifically, we modified the simulator in order to intercept executed instructions as well as register values at each execution. Such modifications do not affect the execution of a program.</p><p>The simulated workload is composed by MiBench [14], that is a free and commercially representative set of benchmarks. From this set, 23 applications have been used, which are divided into six categories:</p><ul><li>Automotive and Industrial Control;</li><li>Network;</li><li>Security;</li><li>Consumer Devices;</li><li>Office Automation; and</li><li>Telecommunications.</li></ul><p>MiBench also has available pre-compiled binaries for ARM architectures, which streamlined the tests presented in this paper.</p><h3>B. Trace Reuse Mechanism</h3><p>For the trace reuse mechanism to be used in the ARM architecture, we first defined the reuse domain, which is the instruction set that is allowed to be reused. Previous studies [9] show that integer instructions without side effects represent on average 66% of all instructions executed by the Sim-Panalyzer simulator using benchmarks from MiBench. Other studies about reuse on MIPS processor observed that including memory instructions in traces requires more complex storage structures and extra mechanisms to control memory data consistency [21]. Furthermore, it was observed that floating-point instructions show less redundancy than integers instructions.</p><p>According to these analysis, this study considers only integer instructions without memory accesses as the reuse domain, as they cover the largest instruction group with greater chances of presenting redundancy and that require the smallest and simplest storage structures. This means that only instructions of this group are able to compose traces and, therefore, only those may be reused. This group allows arithmetic and logic instructions, data movement instructions, comparisons, and branches. With this reuse domain, we have determined the basic structure to represent traces. This structure is detailed in Table II.</p><p>TABLE II<br/>TRACE ENTRY</p><table><thead><tr><th>Entry</th><th>Description</th><th>Size in bits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>pc</td><td>address of first instruction in trace</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>npc</td><td>next instruction address after trace</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>irb</td><td>bitmap of input registers</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>orb</td><td>bitmap of output registers</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>icv</td><td>input context values</td><td><math>32\\times m</math></td></tr><tr><td>ocv</td><td>output context values</td><td><math>32\\times n</math></td></tr><tr><td>icpsrb</td><td>bitmap of input condition flags</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>ocpsrb</td><td>bitmap of output condition flags</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>icpsrv</td><td>values of input condition flags</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>ocpsrv</td><td>values of output condition flags</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This structure represents a trace stored in the memoization table. Both <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> represent how many input and output registers are allowed in the trace, respectively. This trace must be composed of a sequence of instructions from reuse domain and it is finished by an instruction outside this domain. In order to represent the beginning and the end of the instruction sequence, the addresses of the first instruction and the instruction immediately after the end of the sequence are stored (<i>pc</i> and <i>npc</i>).</p><p>For each instruction in the range from the first to the last instruction inside the trace, the values of registers operated by the instructions and the values generated by their executions are stored. Thus, we have a set of input values, which represents the values operated at the trace (<i>irb</i> and <i>icv</i>, defining an input context) \u2013 and a set of output values representing the</p>",

The simulator implements the ARMv7 instruction set [1] and the pipeline of a StrongArm processor [46].

TRACE REUSE EVALUATION</h2><p>This section presents experimental results based on the trace reuse environment and simulator described in Section IV. As reuse mechanisms require extra memory structures close to the processor, similar to L1 caches, the size of the simulated reuse buffers must be limited as it would be the case real hardware implementations. For our experiments, we used FIFO (first in, first out) as the trace replacement policy and limited buffers from 1 KiB to 1024 KiB, in order to cover the most frequently used L1 caches, as well as bigger and smaller sizes for comparison.</p><p>With limited resources, efficient ways to store data for reuse must be established. This paper presents the combination of two limitations to the use of memoization tables: (i) the maximum number of input and output registers of each trace; and (ii) the maximum number of traces inside the memoization table. Considering a fixed buffer size, when changing the maximum number of input and output registers, the size of each trace also changes. This implies a variation in the total number of traces that fit in the buffer. This change in the number of registers causes the following behavior:</p><ul><li>Less registers for trace context:<ul><li>Shorter traces can be formed, decreasing reuse; and</li><li>More traces can fit in the buffer, increasing reuse.</li></ul></li><li>More registers for trace context:<ul><li>Longer traces can be formed, increasing reuse; and</li><li>Less traces can fit in the buffer, decreasing reuse.</li></ul></li></ul><p>With the execution of MiBench benchmarks on the Sim-Panalyzer modified simulator, we have quantified how many traces would be covered for all limitations on input and output registers.

In these cases, the major limitation on reuse is attributed to the lower number of traces that fit in the buffer. However, for larger tablers, the limitation caused by the number of traces in the buffer is less significant. In this way, larger traces, with more input and output registers, can be constructed using buffers from 128 KiB to 1024 KiB.</p><p>The aforementioned behavior can be seen in Figure 3, which shows the density of traces by KiB of memory. For the bigger buffers, from 128 KiB to 1024 KiB, the density is 12.5 traces per KiB, while for the smaller buffers it is 22 traces per KiB. This behavior shows that in smaller buffers, the high density of traces aims to compensate the reduced storage space, which is the main factor that limits reuse. This behavior does not appear in buffers larger than 64 KiB. In tables with more space, the low density of traces does not reduce reuse, allowing the use of more registers in the trace structure.</p><img alt=\"Bar chart showing the density of traces (traces per KiB) for various buffer sizes (1 KiB to 1024 KiB).

Density of traces</p><p>Figure 4 presents the percentage of reuse achieved by the best settings, representing the portion of redundant computing suppressed by the reuse mechanism. The linearity of reuse with different buffer sizes, even those using different configurations, shows that the strategy for limiting input and output registers makes the use of buffers more efficient. Furthermore, these results confirm the applicability of trace reuse on ARM processors using buffers with similar size to those used in L1 caches.</p><p>Without applying limitations on trace formation and storage, it was possible to achieve 32.38% of reuse by designing 400 MiB for reuse tables. On the other hand, a buffer of 32 KiB makes it possible to achieve 18.36% of reuse, which corresponds to more than 56% of the reuse with unlimited tables, but with a fraction of the cost.</p><h2>VI. RELATED WORK</h2><p>Many different mechanisms based on value reuse have been proposed. The reuse granularity includes instructions [34], [40], expressions and invariants [24], basic blocks [18], traces [8], [7], [12], as well as instruction blocks and sub-blocks of arbitrary size [17]. The techniques change in terms of their dependence on hardware and compiler support [17], [47].</p><p>Pratas et al [30] developed a new constrained loop unrolling technique for reusing instruction inside loops in low power architectures. A controller was designed to identify reusable instructions within loops. This technique is more closely related to Trace Caches [33] than trace reuse, as both do not</p>",

For the bigger buffers, from 128 KiB to 1024 KiB, the density is 12.5 traces per KiB, while for the smaller buffers it is 22 traces per KiB. This behavior shows that in smaller buffers, the high density of traces aims to compensate the reduced storage space, which is the main factor that limits reuse. This behavior does not appear in buffers larger than 64 KiB. In tables with more space, the low density of traces does not reduce reuse, allowing the use of more registers in the trace structure.</p>",

Reused instructions using buffer limitations</p><p>store operands but just the instructions themselves. However, [30] does not require an extra buffer, using the reorder buffer as source of instructions.</p><p>Tsumura et al [42] identifies reusable regions by tracking subroutine call and return instructions, or by backward branches in the case of loops. This architecture uses threads running on other cores to validate speculative reuse. Oda et al [26] extended Tsumura\u2019s previous work by improving the efficiency of input memoization.</p><p>Tsai and Chen [41] proposed a Trace Reuse (TR) Cache to reduce energy consumption in embedded systems. Instead of reusing the computations, TR only reuses the decoded sequences of retired instructions, thus avoiding cache misses and improving overall efficiency. However, this mechanism was evaluated for simple embedded processors and may not scale well when used in more complex processors (such as out-of-order ones).</p><p>Rahimi et al [31] uses spatial memoization to reduce the costs of recovering errors in a SIMD architecture. An interesting feature of this work is the absence of reuse tables, where reuse occurs from an instruction running on a strong lane to the ones on the remaining weak lanes. Experimental results showed that 62% of recovery of errant instructions is avoided using their technique. The authors extended their work for floating points in GPUs [32], with results of energy saving from 8 to 28% for error correction.</p><p>In most studies, memory accesses are not reused because of side effects and aliasing disambiguation difficulties. One approach to implement load and store reuse is to manage registers as a level in the memory hierarchy [27]. Another approach employs instruction reuse to exploit both same instruction and different instruction redundancy [48].</p><p>Load value prediction [23] is a specialization where only loads are predicted, motivated by their long latencies and high value locality. Another version [43] uses the value stored in a register as the prediction, without requiring extra tables.</p><p>Many variations on value prediction have been proposed, including two-level value prediction [45], hybrid value prediction [45], [35], and others, many of which were inspired by</p><p>branch prediction. Value prediction based on correlation [45], [36] uses global information about the path in selecting predictions. Prediction of multiple values for traces [35] may be done for only the live-out values in a trace, reducing necessary bandwidth in the predictor. Speculation control [13] is used to balance the benefits of speculation against other possibilities. Confidence mechanisms [5] are employed to improve value prediction by restricting prediction of unpredictable values.</p><p>The upper bound limits of RST architecture (Reuse through Speculation on Traces) in a superscalar architecture with oracle prediction is presented in [28]. Pilla et al. [29] did an extensive study on upper bound limits for feasible architectures, proposing a version with a unified reuse table to further reduce die area requirements. This work was only intended to verify the impact of reducing the reuse domain or by reusing only instructions inside loops in overall performance.</p><p>Tune et al [44] suggest finding and predicting chains of dependent instructions in the critical path to optimize performance. Wu et al. [47] proposed speculative reuse but their work requires compiler support.</p><p>Huang, Choi and Lilja [15] proposed a scheme that uses a Speculative Reuse Cache (SRC) and Combined Dynamic Prediction (CDP) to exploit value reuse and prediction. During execution, a chooser picks a prediction from the value predictor or a speculatively reusable value from SRC. With this approach, they have achieved a speedup of 10% in a 16-wide, 6-stage superscalar architecture, with 128 KB of storage for the CDP.</p><p>Liao and Shieh [22] combined instruction reuse and value prediction, using a reuse buffer and a value prediction table that are accessed in parallel. If inputs are unavailable, the value predictor is used. For a 6-stage pipeline, they achieved an average performance gain of 9%.</p><p>The Contrail architecture [20] used two threads, one with speculative execution running on low-latency functional units, and another thread validating results predicted by the first thread. The speculation thread aims to transform critical paths into non-critical paths, and the execution on slower functional units allows for reductions of up to 40% on energy dissipation. RST does not require an extra thread to validate results from speculation, making it simpler to implement than other approaches. Trace speculation recovery uses a mechanism similar to those used for branch misprediction.</p><p>Auto-memoization for the reuse of loops and functions in ARM processors is proposed by Shibata et al. [38]. They reported that memoization improved performance on an average of 7.9% for a subset of SPEC CPUint 1995. Although they discussed implementation details for their technique in an ARM processor, they did not evaluate the contribution of different instruction types nor they allow for the flexibility of trace reuse.</p><h2>VII.

Larger buffers achieve better results with fewer limitations in context construction, while smaller buffers are more efficient when applying more restrictions. This behavior is due because of the size of each trace and how many traces each buffer size can cover. Thus, it was concluded that the number of traces at smaller buffers is a key factor for reuse, even if the set of traces with possibility of reuse is smaller.</p><p>Finally, the presented results confirm the potential of trace reuse techniques on ARM processors, and demonstrate that it is possible to use realistic buffer sizes, when thinking about hardware implementations. Furthermore, the linearity of reuse results, even in different structures for storing traces, shows the importance of considering the total buffer size when defining the strategy of trace construction and storage.</p><h3>A. Future work</h3><p>As a continuation of this work, we intend to evaluate the reuse potential by restricting the use of buffer according to trace length. Since one of the advantages of reusing traces is the possibility to suppress instruction sequences in a single moment, reusing longer traces tends to get better results. However, due to the greater number of inputs and outputs of longer traces, the probability of redundant traces decreases. Thus, it is important to evaluate the impact of traces of different lengths in reuse mechanisms.</p><p>Trace replacement policies are an important factor that impacts reuse results. Strategies such as a TTL field (time-to-live) for each trace, LRU policy (Least Recently Used) or a FIFO structure (first in, first out) must be compared. So, in order to determine what is the best policy, it is necessary to evaluate two main redundancy features: (i) how many times on average each trace is reused; and (ii) how much time there is between the trace storage and its reuse.</p><p>Another factor that needs to be evaluated relates to the availability of input context values. When making the reuse test, the values of registers may not yet be available to make the comparison. In this case, reuse would be delayed. Pilla et</p><p>al. [29] proposed the use of value speculation to provide input values not available yet, which achieved positive results in the tests performed on MIPS architectures, and this strategy may be evaluated on ARM processors.</p><p>When adding a memory structure at the same level of an L1 cache, the cost of the processor increases. Thus, it is important to compare the performance gains from the addition of the reuse mechanism memory and the increment of the size of the L1 cache. According to the performance of the two approaches, there is a possibility of using part of the L1 cache to implement a reuse buffer without the addition of any extra memory. Thus, instead of focusing on increasing processing power, it is possible to explore the reduction of the computation to reduce the energetic consumption, keeping the original processing power.</p><p>Afterwards, we intend to implement a deeper trace reuse mechanism in the SimPanalyzer simulator in order to evaluate both performance and energy consumption of trace reuse for ARM architectures.</p><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2><p>This work was supported by CAPES/Brasil (Programa Nacional de Coopera\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00eamica da Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior).</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><ol><li>ARM7TDMI - Technical Reference Manual.
