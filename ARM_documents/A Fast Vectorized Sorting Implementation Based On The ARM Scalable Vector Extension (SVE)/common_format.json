The vectorization units (SIMD) are among the few CPUs' parts that can and must be explicitly controlled. In the HPC community, the x86 CPUs and their vectorization instruction sets were de-facto the standard for decades. Each new release of an instruction set was usually a doubling of the vector length coupled with new operations. Each generation was pushing for adapting and improving previous implementations. The release of the ARM scalable vector extension (SVE) changed things radically for several reasons. First, we expect ARM processors to equip many supercomputers in the next years. Second, SVE's interface is different in several aspects from the x86 extensions as it provides different instructions, uses a predicate to control most operations, and has a vector size that is only known at execution time. Therefore, using SVE opens new challenges on how to adapt algorithms including the ones that are already well-optimized on x86. In this paper, we port a hybrid sort based on the well-known Quicksort and Bitonic-sort algorithms. We use a Bitonic sort to process small partitions/arrays and a vectorized partitioning implementation to divide the partitions. We explain how we use the predicates and how we manage the non-static vector size. We also explain how we efficiently implement the sorting kernels. Our approach only needs an array of <math>O(\\log N)</math> for the recursive calls in the partitioning phase, both in the sequential and in the parallel case. We test the performance of our approach on a modern ARMv8.2 (A64FX) CPU and assess the different layers of our implementation by sorting/partitioning integers, double floating-point numbers, and key/value pairs of integers. Our results show that our approach is faster than the GNU C++ sort algorithm by a speedup factor of 4 on average.</p><p>Submitted 30 June 2021<br/>Accepted 12 October 2021<br/>Published 19 November 2021</p><p>Corresponding author<br/>B\u00e9renger Bramas,<br/>berenger.bramas@inria.fr</p><p>Academic editor<br/>Muhammad Aleem</p><p>Additional Information and<br/>Declarations can be found on<br/>page 21</p><p>DOI 10.7717/peerj.cs.769</p><p>\u00a9 Copyright<br/>2021 Bramas</p><p>Distributed under<br/>Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0</p><p>OPEN ACCESS</p><p><b>Subjects</b> Algorithms and Analysis of Algorithms, Distributed and Parallel Computing</p><p><b>Keywords</b> ARM, SVE, Vectorization, Sort</p><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><p>Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science and a critical building block for many types of applications such as, but not limited to, database servers (Graefe, 2006), image rendering engines (Bishop et al., 1998), mining of time series (Raoofy et al., 2020) or JPEG steganography with particle swarm (Snasel et al., 2020).

      "html": "<p>This research of performance is coupled to the changes in CPUs' designs and organization, which includes the vectorization capability.</p><p>The performance of CPUs has improved for several decades by increasing the clock frequency. However, this approach has reached a steady-state due to power dissipation and heat effects. To go beyond this limitation, the manufacturers have used parallelization at multiple levels: by embedding multi-cores in a CPU, by allowing pipelining and out-of-order execution at the instruction-level, by putting multiple computational units in each core, and by supporting vectorization. In this context, vectorization consists in the capability of a CPU core of applying a single instruction on multiple data, a concept called SIMD by Flynn's taxonomy (Flynn, 1972). The consequence of this hardware design is that it is mandatory to vectorize a code to achieve high-performance. On the contrary, the throughput can be reduced by at least a factor equivalent to the length of a vector compared to the theoretical peak of the hardware. For instance, vector sizes for single precision values are 8 in widespread CPUs (AVX2) and 16 (AVX-512) on many computing nodes.</p><p>We can convert many classes of algorithms and computational kernels from a scalar code into a vectorized equivalent without difficulties. Besides, it can be done with auto-vectorization for some of them. However, some algorithms are challenging to adapt because of their memory/data access patterns. Data-processing algorithms (like sorting) are of this kind and require a significant programming effort to be vectorized efficiently. Also, the possibility of creating a fully vectorized implementation, with no scalar sections and with few data transformations, is only possible and efficient if the instruction set extension (IS) provides the needed operations. This is why new ISs together with their new operations make it possible to invent approaches that were not feasible previously, at the cost of reprogramming.</p><p>Vectorizing a code can be described as solving a puzzle, where the board is the target algorithm and the pieces are the size of the vector and the instructions. However, the paradigm changes with SVE (Stephens et al., 2017; ARM, 2020b; ARM, 2020a) because the size of the vector is unknown at compile time. This can have a significant impact on the transformation from scalar to vectorial. As an example, consider that a developer wants to work on a fixed number of values, which could be linked to the problem to solve, e.g., a <math>16 \\times 16</math> matrix-matrix product, or based on other references, e.g., the size of the L1 cache. When the size of the vector is known at development time, a block of data can be mapped to the corresponding number of vectors and working on the vectors can be done with static/known number of operations. With a variable size, it is required to either implement different kernels for each of the possible sizes (like if they were different ISs) or by finding a generic way to vectorize the kernel, which could be a tedious task. We could expect SVE to be less upgraded than x86 ISs because there will be no need to release a new IS even when new CPU generations will support larger vectors.</p><p>In the current paper, we focus on the adaptation of a sorting strategy and its efficient implementation for the ARM CPUs with SVE. Our implementation is generic and works for any size equal to a power of two. The contributions of this study are:</p><ul><li>Describe how we port our AVX-SORT algorithm (Bramas, 2017) to SVE;</li></ul>",

However, this approach has reached a steady-state due to power dissipation and heat effects. To go beyond this limitation, the manufacturers have used parallelization at multiple levels: by embedding multi-cores in a CPU, by allowing pipelining and out-of-order execution at the instruction-level, by putting multiple computational units in each core, and by supporting vectorization. In this context, vectorization consists in the capability of a CPU core of applying a single instruction on multiple data, a concept called SIMD by Flynn's taxonomy (Flynn, 1972). The consequence of this hardware design is that it is mandatory to vectorize a code to achieve high-performance. On the contrary, the throughput can be reduced by at least a factor equivalent to the length of a vector compared to the theoretical peak of the hardware. For instance, vector sizes for single precision values are 8 in widespread CPUs (AVX2) and 16 (AVX-512) on many computing nodes.</p>",

However, the paradigm changes with SVE (Stephens et al., 2017; ARM, 2020b; ARM, 2020a) because the size of the vector is unknown at compile time. This can have a significant impact on the transformation from scalar to vectorial. As an example, consider that a developer wants to work on a fixed number of values, which could be linked to the problem to solve, e.g., a <math>16 \\times 16</math> matrix-matrix product, or based on other references, e.g., the size of the L1 cache. When the size of the vector is known at development time, a block of data can be mapped to the corresponding number of vectors and working on the vectors can be done with static/known number of operations. With a variable size, it is required to either implement different kernels for each of the possible sizes (like if they were different ISs) or by finding a generic way to vectorize the kernel, which could be a tedious task. We could expect SVE to be less upgraded than x86 ISs because there will be no need to release a new IS even when new CPU generations will support larger vectors.</p>",

The partitioning algorithm moves the values lower than a <i>pivot</i> at the beginning of the array, and greater values at the end, with a linear complexity. The worst-case complexity of QS is <math>O(n^2)</math>, but in practice it has an average complexity of <math>O(n \\log n)</math>. The complexity is tied to the pivot, and it must be close to the median to ensure a low complexity. However, it is a very popular sorting algorithm thanks to its simplicity in terms of implementation, and its speed in practice. An example of a QS execution is provided in Fig. 1.</p><p>To parallelize the QS and other <i>divide-and-conquer</i> approaches, it is common to create a task for each recursive call followed by a wait statement. For instance, a thread partitions the array in two, and then creates two tasks (one for each of the partition). To ensure</p>",

The worst-case complexity of QS is <math>O(n^2)</math>, but in practice it has an average complexity of <math>O(n \\log n)</math>. The complexity is tied to the pivot, and it must be close to the median to ensure a low complexity.

We refer to this parallel strategy as the <i>QS-par</i>.</p><h3><b><i>GNU std::sort implementation (STL)</i></b></h3><p>The standard requires a worst-case complexity of <math>O(n \\log n)</math> (ISO, 2014) (it was an average complexity until year 2003 (ISO, 2003) that a pure QS implementation cannot guarantee. Consequently, the QS algorithm cannot be used alone as a standard C++ sort. As a result, the current STL implementation relies on 3 different algorithms<sup>3</sup>. This i3-part hybrid sorting algorithm is composed of an Introsort (M\u00fcsser, 1997) to a maximum depth of <math>2 \\times \\log^2 n</math> to obtain small partitions. These partitions are then sorted using an insertion sort, which is a 2-part hybrid composed of Quicksort and Heapsort.</p><h3><b><i>Bitonic sorting network</i></b></h3><p>In computer science, a sorting network is an abstract that describes how the values to sort are compared and exchanged. A network is defined for a given number of values. It is possible to represent graphically a sorting network where horizontal lines represent the input values, and vertical connection between those lines represent <i>compare and exchange</i> units. The literature provides various examples of sorting networks, and our approach relies on the Bitonic sort (Batcher, 1968). This network is straightforward to implement and its algorithm complexity for any input is of <math>O(n \\log(n)^2)</math>. This algorithm demonstrated good performances on parallel computers (Nassimi &amp; Sahni, 1979) and GPUs (Owens et al., 2008). We provide a Bitonic sorting network to sort 16 values in Fig. 2A. The execution of the example goes from left to right as a timeline. The values are moved from left to right, and when they cross an exchange unit they are potentially transferred along the vertical bar. Figure 2B provide a real example where we print the values along the horizontal lines when sorting eight values. We use the terms <i>symmetric</i> and <i>stair</i> exchanges to refer to the red and orange stages, respectively. A <i>symmetric</i> stage is always followed by <i>stair</i> stages from half size to size two. The Bitonic sort does not maintain the original order of the values and thus is not stable.</p><p>We can implement a sorting network by hard-coding the connections between the lines only if we know the size of the input array. In this case, we simply translate the picture into an algorithm. However, for a dynamic array size, the implementation has to be flexible by relying on formulas that define when the lines cross (Grama et al., 2003).</p><h3><b><i>Vectorization</i></b></h3><p>The word vectorization defines a CPU capability of applying a single operation/instruction to a vector of values, instead of a single/scalar value (Kogge, 1981). Thanks to this feature, the peak performance of single cores had continued to increase despite the stagnation of the clock frequency since the mid-2000s. In the meanwhile, the length of the SIMD registers (<i>i.e.</i>, the size of the vectors) has continuously increased, which increases the performance of the chips accordingly. In the current study, the term <i>vector</i> has no relation to an expandable vector data structure, such as <i>std::vector</i>, but refers to the data type managed by the CPU in this sense.

There is usually a one-to-one mapping between intrinsics and assembly instructions, but this is not always true, as some intrinsics are converted into several instructions. Moreover, the compiler is free to use different instructions as long as they give the same results.</p><p>The SVE is a feature for ARMv8 processors. The size of the vector is not fixed at compile time (the specification limits the size to 2048 bits and ensures that it is a multiple of 128 bits) such that a binary that includes SVE instructions can be executed on ARMv8 that support SVE no matter the size of their registers. Figure 3 illustrates the difference between a scalar summation and a vector summation with a vector size of 256 bits.</p><p>SVE provides most classic operations that also exist in x86 vectorization extensions, such as loading a contiguous block of values from the main memory and transforming it into a SIMD-vector (load), filling a SIMD-vector with a value (set), move back a SIMD-vector into memory (store) and basic arithmetic operations. SVE also provides advanced operations</p>",

However, both approaches need extra Boolean or indices vectors and additional instructions.</p><h3>Related work on vectorized sorting algorithms</h3><p>The literature on sorting and vectorized sorting implementations is very large. Therefore, we only cite some studies we consider most related to our work.</p><p><i>Sanders &amp; Winkel (2004)</i> provide a sorting technique that tries to remove branches and improves the prediction of a scalar sort. The results show that the method provides a speedup by a factor of 2 against the STL (the implementation of the STL was different). This study illustrates the early strategy to adapt sorting algorithms to a given hardware, and also shows the need for low-level optimizations, due to the limited instructions available.</p><p>Later, <i>Inoue et al. (2007)</i> propose a parallel sorting on top of combosort vectorized with the VMX instruction set of IBM architecture. Unaligned memory access is avoided, and the L2 cache is efficiently managed by using an out-of-core/blocking scheme. The authors show a speedup by a factor of 3 against the GNU C++ STL.</p><p>In a different study (<i>Furtak, Amaral &amp; Niewiadomski, 2007</i>), Furtak et al. use a sorting-network for small-sized arrays, similar to our own approach. However, instead of dividing the main array into sorted partitions (partitions of increasing contents), and applying a small efficient sort on each of those partitions, the authors perform the opposite. They apply multiple small sorts on sub-parts of the array, and then they finish with a complicated merge scheme using extra memory to sort globally all the sub-parts. A very similar approach was later proposed by <i>Chhugani et al. (2008)</i>. More recently, <i>Gueron &amp; Krasnov (2016)</i> provided a new approach for AVX2. The authors use a Quicksort variant with a vectorized partitioning function, and an insertion sort once the partitions are small enough (as the STL does). The partition method relies on look-up tables, with a mapping between the comparison's result of an SIMD-vector against the pivot, and the move/permutation that must be applied to the vector. The authors show a speedup by a factor of 4 against the STL, but their approach is not always faster than the Intel IPP library. The proposed method is not suitable for AVX-512 because the lookup tables will occupy too much memory. This issue and the use of extra memory, can be solved with the new instructions of the AVX-512. As a side remark, the authors do not compare their proposal to the standard C++ <i>partition</i> function. It is the only part of their algorithm that is vectorized.</p>",

However, instead of dividing the main array into sorted partitions (partitions of increasing contents), and applying a small efficient sort on each of those partitions, the authors perform the opposite. They apply multiple small sorts on sub-parts of the array, and then they finish with a complicated merge scheme using extra memory to sort globally all the sub-parts. A very similar approach was later proposed by <i>Chhugani et al. (2008)</i>. More recently, <i>Gueron &amp; Krasnov (2016)</i> provided a new approach for AVX2. The authors use a Quicksort variant with a vectorized partitioning function, and an insertion sort once the partitions are small enough (as the STL does). The partition method relies on look-up tables, with a mapping between the comparison's result of an SIMD-vector against the pivot, and the move/permutation that must be applied to the vector. The authors show a speedup by a factor of 4 against the STL, but their approach is not always faster than the Intel IPP library. The proposed method is not suitable for AVX-512 because the lookup tables will occupy too much memory. This issue and the use of extra memory, can be solved with the new instructions of the AVX-512. As a side remark, the authors do not compare their proposal to the standard C++ <i>partition</i> function. It is the only part of their algorithm that is vectorized.</p>",

Then, we sort each vector individually, and finally we exchange values between vectors either during the <i>symmetric</i> or <i>stair</i> stage. Our method was eight times faster to sort small arrays and 1.7 times faster to sort large arrays compared to the Intel IPP library. However, our method was sequential and could not simply be converted to SVE when we consider that the vector size is unknown at compile time. In this study, we refer to this approach as the AVX-512-QS.</p><p><i>Hou, Wang &amp; Feng (2018)</i> designed a framework for the automatic vectorization of parallel sort on x86-based processors. Using a DSL, their tool generates a SIMD sorting network based on a formula. Their approach shows a significant speedup against STL, and especially they show a speedup of 6.7 in parallel against the sort from Intel TBB on Intel Knights Corner MIC. The method is of great interest as it avoids programming by hand the core of the sorting kernel. Any modification, such as the use of a new IS, requires upgrading the framework. To the best of our knowledge, they do not support SVE yet.</p><p><i>Yin et al. (2019)</i> described an efficient parallel sort on AVX-512-based multi-core and many-core architectures. Their approach achieves to sort 1.1 billion floats per second on an Intel KNL (AVX-512). Their parallel algorithm is similar to the one we use in the current study because they first sort sub-parts of the input array and then merge them by pairs until there is only one result. However, their parallel merging is out-of-place and requires doubling the needed memory, which is not the case for us. Besides, their Bitonic sorting kernel differs from ours, because we follow the Bitonic algorithm without the need for matrix transposition inside the registers.</p><p><i>Watkins &amp; Green (2018)</i> provide an alternative approach to sort based on the merging of multiple vectors. Their method is two times faster than the Intel IPP library and 5 times faster than the C-lib <i>qsort</i>. They can sort 500 million keys per second on an Intel KNL (AVX-512) but they also need to have an external array when merging, which we avoid in our approach.</p><h3>Related work on vectorized with SVE</h3><p>Developing optimized kernels with SVE is a recent research topic. We refer to studies that helped better understand this architecture, even if they did not focus on sorting.</p><p><i>Meyer et al. (2018)</i> studied the assembly code generated when implementing lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) kernels. They evaluate if the compiler was capable of generating vectorized assembly from a scalar C code, which was the case. LQCD has also been studied by <i>Alappat et al. (2021)</i> in addition to sparse matrix vector product (SpMV). The authors studied various effects and properties of the A64FX, and demonstrated that for some kernels it competes with a V100 GPU.</p><p><i>Kodama et al. (2017)</i> tried evaluating the impact on performance when changing the vector size, while using the same hardware. Their objective was oriented to SVE since SVE kernels are vector size independent. At the time of the study, no hardware was supported SVE, hence the authors used an emulator. Additionally, they speculated on how the vector</p>",

First, we partition the data recursively using the <i>sve_partition</i> function described in 'Partitioning with SVE', as in the classical QS. Second, once the partitions are smaller than a given threshold, we sort them with the <i>sve_bitonic_sort_wrapper</i> function from 'Bitonic-based sort on SVE vectors'. To sort in parallel, we rely on the classical parallelization scheme for the divide-and-conquer algorithm, but propose several optimizations. This allows an easy parallelization method, which can be fully implemented using OpenMP.</p><h3>Bitonic-based sort on SVE vectors</h3><p>In this section, we detail our Bitonic-sort to sort small arrays that have less than 16 times <i>VEC_SIZE</i> elements, where <i>VEC_SIZE</i> is the size of a SIMD vector. We used this function in our QS implementation to sort partitions that are small enough.</p><h4>Sorting one vector</h4><p>We sort a single vector by applying the same operations as the ones shown in Fig. 2A. We perform the compare and exchange following the indexes shown in the Bitonic sorting network figure. Thanks to the vectorization, we are able to work on an entire vector without the need of iterating on the values individually. However, we cannot hard-code the indices of the elements that should be compared and exchanged, because we do not know the size of the vector. Therefore, we use a loop-based scheme where we efficiently generate permutation and Boolean vectors to perform the correct comparisons. We use the same pattern for both the <i>symmetric</i> and the <i>stair</i> stages.</p><p>In the <i>symmetric</i> stage, the values are first compared by contiguous pairs, e.g. each value at an even index <i>i</i> is compared with the value at <i>i</i>+1 and each value at an odd index <i>j</i> is compared with the value at <i>j</i>-1. Additionally, we see in Fig. 2A that the width of comparison doubles at each iteration and that the comparisons are from the sides to</p>",

First, a Boolean vector that shows the direction of the comparisons, e.i. for each index it tells if it has to be compared with a value at a greater index (and will take the minimum of both) or with a value at a lower index (and will take the maximum of both). Second, we need a shift coefficient vector which gives the step of the comparisons, i.e. it tells for each index the relative position of the index to be compared with. Finally, we need an index vector that contains increasing values from 0 to N-1 (for any index <math>i</math>, <math>\\text{vec}[i] = i</math>) and that we use to sum with the shift coefficient vector to get a permutation vector.

In the beginning, the Boolean vector must contain repeated <i>false</i> and <i>true</i> values because the values are compared by contiguous pairs. To build it, we use the <i>svzip1</i> instruction which interleaves elements from low halves of two inputs, and pass one vector of <i>true</i> and a vector of <i>false</i> as parameters (line 7). Then, at each iteration, the number of <i>false</i> should double and be followed by the same number of <i>true</i>. To do so, we use again the <i>svzip1</i> instruction, but we pass the Boolean vector as parameters (line 7). The vector of increasing indexes is built with a single SVE instruction (line 5). The shift coefficients vector is built by interleaving 1 and -1 (line 9). The permutation index is generated by summing the two vectors (line 12) and uses to permute the input (line 14). So, at each iteration, we use the updated Boolean vector to decide if we add or subtract two times the iteration index (line 22). Also, this algorithm is never used as presented here because each of its iterations must be followed by a <i>stair</i> stage.</p><h4>Algorithm 1: SVE Bitonic sort for one vector, symmetric stage.</h4><pre>Input: vec: a SVE vector to sort.\nOutput: vec: the vector sorted.\n\nfunction sve_bitonic_sort_1v_symmetric(vec)\n    //Number of values in a vector\n    N = get_hardware_size()\n    //svindex [0, 1, ..., N-1] vecindexes = (i in [0, N-1] \u2192 i)\n    //svzip1 - [F, T, F, T, ..., F, T]\n    falseTrueVecOut = (i in [0, N-1] \u2192 i is odd ?

We select the appropriate SVE-Bitonic function (the one that matches the size of the array to sort) with a switch statement, in a function interface that we refer to as <i>sve_bionic_sort_wrapper</i>. However, the partitions obtained from the QS do not necessarily have a size multiple of the vector's length. Therefore, we pad the last vector with an extra value, which is the greatest possible value for the target data type. During the execution of the sort, these last values will be compared but never exchanged and will remain at the end of the last vector.</p><h3><b>Optimization by comparing vectors' min/max values or whether vectors are already sorted</b></h3><p>There are two main points where we can apply optimization in our implementation. The first one is to avoid exchanging values between vectors if their contents are already in the correct order, <i>i.e.</i> no values will be exchanged between the vectors because their values respect the ordering objective. For instance, in Algorithm 3, we can compare if the greatest value in vector <i>vec2</i> (SVE instruction <i>s vmaxv</i>) is lower than or equal to the lowest value in vector <i>vec1</i> (SVE instruction <i>s vminv</i>). If this is the case, the function can simply sort each vector individually. The same mechanism can be applied to any number of vectors, and it can be used at function entry or inside the loops to break when it is known that no more values will be exchanged. The second optimization can be applied when we want to sort a single vector by checking if it is already sorted. Similarly to the first optimization, this check can be done at function entry or in the loops, such as at lines 2 and 10, in Algorithm</p>",

If this is the case, the function can simply sort each vector individually.

      "html": "<p>2. We propose two implementations to test if a vector is sorted and provide the details in Appendix A.2.</p><h3>Partitioning with SVE</h3><p>Our partitioning strategy is based on the AVX-512-partition. In this algorithm, we start by saving the extremities of the input array into two vectors that remain unchanged until the end of the algorithm. By doing so, we free the extremity of the array that can be overwritten. Then, in the core part of the algorithm, we load a vector and compare it to the pivot. The values lower than the pivot are stored on the left side of the array, and the values greater than the pivot are stored on the right side while moving the corresponding cursor indexes. Finally, when there is no more value to load, the two vectors that were loaded at the beginning are compared to the pivot and stored in the array accordingly.</p><p>When we implement this algorithm using SVE we obtain a Boolean vector <i>b</i> when we compare a vector to partition with the pivot. We use <i>b</i> to compact the vector and move the values lower or equal than the pivot on the left, and then we generate a secondary Boolean vector to store only as a sub-part of the vector. We manage the values greater than the pivot similarly by using the negate of <i>b</i>.</p><h3>Sorting key/value pairs</h3><p>The sorting methods we have described are designed to sort arrays of numbers. However, some applications need to sort key/value pairs. More precisely, the sort is applied on the keys, and the values contain extra information such as pointers to arbitrary data structures, for example. We extend our SVE-Bitonic and SVE-Partition functions by making sure that the same permutations/moves apply to the keys and the values. In the sort kernels, we replace the minimum and maximum statements with a comparison operator that gives us a Boolean vector. We use this vector to transform both the vector of keys and the vector of values. For the partitioning kernel, we already use a comparison operator, therefore, we add extra code to apply the same transformations to the vector of values and the vector of keys.</p><p>In terms of high-level data structure, we support two approaches. In the first one, we store the keys and the values in two distinct arrays, which allow us to use contiguous load/store. In the second one, the key/value is stored by pair contiguously in a single array, such that loading/storing requires non-contiguous memory accesses.</p><h3>Parallel sorting</h3><p>Our parallel implementation is based on the <i>QS-par</i> that we extend with several optimizations. In the <i>QS-par</i> parallelization strategy, it is possible to avoid having too many tasks or tasks on too small partitions by stopping creating tasks after a given recursive level. This approach allows to fix the number of tasks at the beginning, but could end in an unbalanced configuration (if the tasks have different workload) that is difficult to resolve on the fly. Therefore, in our implementation, we create a task for every partition larger than the L1 cache, as shown in Algorithm 4 line 26. However, we do not rely on the OpenMP task statement because it is impossible to control the data locality. Instead, we use one task list per thread (lines 2, 11 and 33). Each thread uses its list as a stack to store the</p>",

We use a work-stealing strategy when a thread has an empty list such that the thread will try to pick a task in others' lists.

      "html": "<p>the GNU STL 20200312 from which we use the <code>std::sort</code> and <code>std::partition</code> functions. We also compare against SVE512-Bitonic, which is an implementation that we have obtained by performing a translation of our original AVX-512 into SVE. This implementation works only for 512-bit SVE, but this makes it possible to hard-code all the indices of the compare and exchange of the Bitonic algorithm. Moreover, SVE512-Bitonic does not use any loop, i.e. it can be seen as if we had fully unrolled the loops of the SVE-Bitonic.</p><p>We compare our parallel implementation against the Boost (<a href=\"https://www.boost.org/\">https://www.boost.org/</a>) 1.73.0 from which we use the <code>block_in_direct_sort</code> function. The test file used for the following benchmark is available online (<a href=\"https://gitlab.inria.fr/bramas/arm-sve-sort/\">https://gitlab.inria.fr/bramas/arm-sve-sort/</a>) and includes the different sorts presented in this study, plus some additional strategies and tests<sup>4</sup>. Our QS uses a 5-values median pivot selection (whereas the STL sort function uses a 3-values median). The arrays to sort are populated with randomly generated values. Our implementation does not include the potential optimizations described in \u201cOptimization by comparing vectors\u2019 min/max values or whether vectors are already sorted\u201d that can be applied when there is a chance that parts or totality of the input array are already sorted<sup>5</sup>.</p><p>As it is possible to virtually change the size of the SIMD vectors at runtime, we evaluated if using different vector sizes (128 or 256) could increase the performance of our approach. It appears that the performance was always worse, and consequently we decided not to include these results in the current study.</p><h3>Performance to sort small arrays</h3><p>We provide in Fig. 4 the execution times to sort arrays of 1 element to <math>16 \\times \\text{VEC\\_SIZE}</math> elements. This corresponds to at most 128 double floating-point values, or 256 integer values. We test all the sizes by step 1, such that we include sizes not multiple of the SIMD-vector\u2019s length. For more than 20 values, the SVE-Bitonic always delivers better performance than the STL. The speedup is significant and increases with the number of values to reach 5 for 256 integer values. The execution time per item increases every <math>\\text{VEC\\_SIZE}</math> values because the cost of sorting is not tied to the number of values but to the number of SIMD-vectors to sort, as explained in \u2018Sorting small arrays\u2019. For example, we have to sort two SIMD-vector of 16 values to process from 17 to 32 integers. Our method reaches a speedup of 3.6 to sort key/value pairs. To sort key/value pairs, we obtain similar performance if we sort pairs of integers stored contiguously or two arrays of integers, one for the keys and one for the values. Comparing our two SVE implementations, SVE-Bitonic appears more efficient than SVE512-bitonic, except for very small number of values. This means that considering a static vector size of 512 bits, with compare-exchange indices hard coded and no loops/branches, does not provide any benefit, and is even slower for more than 70 values. This means that, for our kernels, the CPU manages more easily loops with branches (SVE-bitonic) than a large amount of instructions without branches (SVE512-bitonic). Moreover, the hard-coded exchange indices are stored in memory and should be load to register, which appear to hurt the performance compared to building these indices using several instructions. Sorting double floating-points values or pairs of integers takes similar duration up to 64 values, then with more values it is faster to sort pairs of integers.</p><p><sup>4</sup>It can be executed on any CPU using the Farm-SVE library (<a href=\"https://gitlab.inria.fr/bramas/arm-sve/\">https://gitlab.inria.fr/bramas/arm-sve/</a>)</p><p><sup>5</sup>This implementation is partially implemented in the branch <i>optim</i> of the code repository.</p>",

This corresponds to at most 128 double floating-point values, or 256 integer values. We test all the sizes by step 1, such that we include sizes not multiple of the SIMD-vector\u2019s length. For more than 20 values, the SVE-Bitonic always delivers better performance than the STL. The speedup is significant and increases with the number of values to reach 5 for 256 integer values. The execution time per item increases every <math>\\text{VEC\\_SIZE}</math> values because the cost of sorting is not tied to the number of values but to the number of SIMD-vectors to sort, as explained in \u2018Sorting small arrays\u2019. For example, we have to sort two SIMD-vector of 16 values to process from 17 to 32 integers. Our method reaches a speedup of 3.6 to sort key/value pairs. To sort key/value pairs, we obtain similar performance if we sort pairs of integers stored contiguously or two arrays of integers, one for the keys and one for the values. Comparing our two SVE implementations, SVE-Bitonic appears more efficient than SVE512-bitonic, except for very small number of values. This means that considering a static vector size of 512 bits, with compare-exchange indices hard coded and no loops/branches, does not provide any benefit, and is even slower for more than 70 values. This means that, for our kernels, the CPU manages more easily loops with branches (SVE-bitonic) than a large amount of instructions without branches (SVE512-bitonic). Moreover, the hard-coded exchange indices are stored in memory and should be load to register, which appear to hurt the performance compared to building these indices using several instructions. Sorting double floating-points values or pairs of integers takes similar duration up to 64 values, then with more values it is faster to sort pairs of integers.</p>",

Our method provides again a speedup of an average factor of 4 for integers and key/values (with two arrays), and 3 for floating-point values. We see no difference if the data fit in the caches L1/L2 or not, neither in terms of performance nor in the difference between the STL and our implementation. However, there is a significant difference between partitioning two arrays of integers (one for the key and the other for the values) or one array of pairs of integers. The only difference between both implementations is that we work with distinct <code>svint32_t</code> vectors in the first one, and with <code>svint32x2_t</code> vector pairs in the second. But the difference is mainly in the memory accesses during the loads/stores. The partitioning of one array or two arrays of integers appears equivalent, and this can be unexpected because we need more instructions when managing the latter.</p>",

Our method provides again a speedup of an average factor of 4 for integers and key/values (with two arrays), and 3 for floating-point values. We see no difference if the data fit in the caches L1/L2 or not, neither in terms of performance nor in the difference between the STL and our implementation. However, there is a significant difference between partitioning two arrays of integers (one for the key and the other for the values) or one array of pairs of integers. The only difference between both implementations is that we work with distinct <code>svint32_t</code> vectors in the first one, and with <code>svint32x2_t</code> vector pairs in the second. But the difference is mainly in the memory accesses during the loads/stores. The partitioning of one array or two arrays of integers appears equivalent, and this can be unexpected because we need more instructions when managing the latter.</p>",

Our SVE-QS is always faster in all configurations. The difference between SVE-QS and the STL sort is stable for size greater than <math>10^3</math> values with a speedup of more than 4 to our benefit to sort integers. There is an effect when sorting 64 values (the left-wise points) as the execution time is not the same as the one observed when sorting less than 16 vectors (Fig. 4). The only difference is that here we call the main SVE-QS functions, which call the SVE-Bitonic functions after just one test on the size, whereas in the previous results we call the SVE-Bitonic functions directly. We observe that when sorting key/value pairs, there is again a benefit when using two distinct arrays of scalars compared with a single array of pairs. From the previous results, it is clear that this difference comes from the partitioning for which the difference also exists (Fig. 6), whereas the difference is negligible in the sorting of arrays smaller than 16 vectors (Fig. 4). However, as the size of the array increases, this difference vanishes, and it becomes even faster to sort Floating-point values than keys/values.</p>",

          "html": "<p><b>Figure 6</b> shows the execution times to sort arrays up to a size of <math>\\approx 10^9</math> items. Our SVE-QS is always faster in all configurations. The difference between SVE-QS and the STL sort is stable for size greater than <math>10^3</math> values with a speedup of more than 4 to our benefit to sort integers. There is an effect when sorting 64 values (the left-wise points) as the execution time is not the same as the one observed when sorting less than 16 vectors (Fig. 4). The only difference is that here we call the main SVE-QS functions, which call the SVE-Bitonic functions after just one test on the size, whereas in the previous results we call the SVE-Bitonic functions directly. We observe that when sorting key/value pairs, there is again a benefit when using two distinct arrays of scalars compared with a single array of pairs. From the previous results, it is clear that this difference comes from the partitioning for which the difference also exists (Fig. 6), whereas the difference is negligible in the sorting of arrays smaller than 16 vectors (Fig. 4). However, as the size of the array increases, this difference vanishes, and it becomes even faster to sort Floating-point values than keys/values.</p>",

This was almost 10 times faster than the STL (<math>10^{-8}</math> second per element). The speedup obtained with SVE in the current study is lower and does not come from our new implementation, which is generic regarding the vector size, because the SVE512-QS is not faster, either. The difference does not come either from the memory accesses, because it is significant for small arrays (that fit in the L1 cache), or the number of vectorial registers, which is 32 for both hardware. Profiling the code reveals that the cycles per instruction is around 1.7 for both SVE512-QS and SVE-QS in sequential, which is not ideal. The L2 cache miss rate is lower than 10%, which indicates that the memory access pattern is adequate. The memory bandwidth is given in Table 1. We observe that the peak of HBM2 (256GB/s) is not reached. Additionally, the table indicates that to sort 4GB of data, our approach will read/write 252GB of data, but it was already the case for AVX-512-QS. From the hardware specification of the A64FX (Fujitsu, 0000), we can observe that most SIMD SVE instructions have a latency between 4 and 9 cycles. Therefore, we conclude that the difference between our AVX-512 and SVE versions comes from the cost of the SIMD instructions and the pipelining of these because the memory access appears fine, and the difference is already significant for small arrays.</p><h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2><p>In this paper, we described new implementations of the Bitonic sorting network and the partition algorithm that have been designed for the SVE instruction set. These two algorithms are used in our Quicksort variant, which makes it possible to have a fully vectorized implementation. Our approach shows superior performance on ARMv8.2 (A64FX) in all configurations against the GNU C++ STL. It provides a speedup up of five when sorting small arrays (less than 16 SIMD-vectors), and a speedup above four for large arrays. We also demonstrate that our algorithm is less efficient when we fully unroll the loops and use hard-coded exchange indices in the Bitonic stage (by considering that the vector if of size 512bits). This strategy was efficient when implemented with AVX512 and executed on Intel Skylake.
