ARM11 Pipeline Structure</p><p>Highly-pipelined structures can impair efficiency by introducing excessive delays, or latency, into the system. In general, long pipelines mean that execution of some instructions may be delayed, because they depend on the results of previous instructions - the ARM11 pipeline avoids these delays by extensive use of <i>forwarding</i> within the pipeline. A processor with a long pipeline may also lose performance when something happens to interrupt the smooth flow of instructions through the pipeline - for example, a branch instruction. The ARM11 pipeline avoids these delays by using branch prediction to predict the flow of instructions. These forwarding and prediction techniques maintain good pipeline efficiency by reducing pipeline 'stalls' - i.e. situations where the processor has to wait because its next instruction is still rippling through the pipeline.</p><p>Together, these pipeline optimizations deliver much higher throughput, but at the same effective latency as a 5-stage pipeline, such as that found in the ARM9 microarchitecture.</p><h4>Single Instruction Issue</h4><p>The ARM11 microarchitecture pipeline is <i>scalar</i>, in other words it issues a single instruction at a time (single issue). Some pipeline architectures are capable of issuing multiple instructions at a time - for example, to the ALU and MAC pipelines.</p><p>In theory, <i>multiple issue</i> microarchitectures should have an efficiency advantage. In practice, multiple issue machines vastly increase the complexity in the front-end pipeline instruction decoding stages, since the processing of instruction dependencies becomes much more involved. This increased complexity has a significant impact on the power consumption and area of the processor.</p>",

          "html": "<p>Highly-pipelined structures can impair efficiency by introducing excessive delays, or latency, into the system. In general, long pipelines mean that execution of some instructions may be delayed, because they depend on the results of previous instructions - the ARM11 pipeline avoids these delays by extensive use of <i>forwarding</i> within the pipeline. A processor with a long pipeline may also lose performance when something happens to interrupt the smooth flow of instructions through the pipeline - for example, a branch instruction. The ARM11 pipeline avoids these delays by using branch prediction to predict the flow of instructions. These forwarding and prediction techniques maintain good pipeline efficiency by reducing pipeline 'stalls' - i.e. situations where the processor has to wait because its next instruction is still rippling through the pipeline.</p>",

In other words, they require some condition to be tested \u2013 such as examining a condition code register, before jumping to another instruction, or just continuing through the current sequence. Branching can cause delays in the pipeline, since the result of the condition code needed by the branch instruction may not be available until three or four cycles after the instruction decoder encounters the branch. Predicting where a branch should be directed (its <i>destination</i>), will help avoid this delay.</p><p>The ARM11 microarchitecture uses two techniques to predict branches. First, the dynamic branch predictor uses a historical record to see whether the branch has been seen before, and whether it was most-frequently taken, or most frequently not taken</p><p>A 64-entry, 4-state branch target address cache (BTAC) is maintained. This table is sufficient to hold the majority of most recent branches \u2013 those that are most likely to be seen again</p><p>If the branch prediction has been encountered before, a prediction is made based on the previous outcome.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Strongly Taken</td></tr><tr><td>Weakly Taken</td></tr><tr><td>Strongly not Taken</td></tr><tr><td>Weakly not Taken</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Figure 4. Branch Prediction States</p><p>If the dynamic branch predictor cannot find a record of the branch instruction, a static branch prediction procedure takes over.</p><p>Very simply, the static prediction looks at the branch to see whether it is going backwards or forwards. If backwards, it assumes it's a loop, and takes the branch. If it's a forward branch, it doesn't take the branch.</p><p>The return stack manages branch prediction for returns from up to three procedure calls. Similarly, these are treated as conditional branches.</p><p>As well as predicting branches, the ARM pipeline will also <i>fold</i> the branches. This means that if the result of the branch prediction is that the branch won't be taken, the original branch instruction is removed or 'folded' from the pipeline, as there is no point in executing it. This saves a clock cycle for a correctly predicted branch.</p>",

The memory management architectural enhancements improve the overall processor performance significantly \u2013 especially for platform-type applications where operating systems need to manage frequent task changes.</p><p>With the changes in ARMv6, instructions and data for more tasks can remain resident in the cache for longer, so cache misses are much more infrequent, and the performance of the processor is increased.</p><p>One of the microarchitectural improvements in ARM11 cores is the <i>non-blocking</i>, and <i>hit-under-miss</i> operation of the memory system. When an instruction requests data from a cache, if the data is not there, a cache 'miss' results, and the pipeline of a simpler processor design would stop. However, ARM11 treats this as a <i>non-blocking</i> operation.</p><p>The cache is instructed to get the missing data, then the pipeline execution can continue as long as the next instructions are not dependent on the missing data. Even if the next instruction is another data load, the ARM11 microarchitecture permits this operation if the data is in the cache (i.e. a hit-under-miss). Only if three successive data misses are encountered, will the pipeline stall. For most applications, this is a very infrequent occurrence.</p><h3>Pipeline Parallelism</h3><p>Although the pipeline is single issue, parallelism is exploited in the back end of the pipeline architecture, with separate processing units for the ALU, multiply-accumulate (MAC) and Load-Store (LS) instructions.</p><p>The LS pipeline is dedicated to processing load and store instructions. Decoupling the execution of arithmetic instructions from memory instructions (LS) enables more efficient processing as Execution of LS instructions can often be constrained by the availability of external memory (see the explanation of non-blocking and hit-under-miss operation above for how the ARM11 microarchitecture is optimised to cope with this).</p><p>In microarchitectures where the LS unit is part of the main pipeline, the pipeline can be easily stalled waiting for memory operations to complete. With a separate LS pipeline as implemented in the ARM11 microarchitecture, the execution of an ALU or MAC instruction will not be delayed by a waiting LS instruction. This also allows a software compiler more freedom in scheduling code, which also helps to improve performance.</p><p>Processing LS instructions is split over two cycles for data cache access. Pipelining the LS unit in this way, means that ARM11 cores are suitable for use in ASIC designs built with commercially available RAM compilers: high-speed, custom memory is not necessary to ensure maximum processor performance.</p>",

This means that instructions that have no dependency on the outcome of previous instructions can complete their execution without waiting. Completed instructions free up the resources for execution of the next instruction.</p><h3>64-bit Data Paths</h3><p>For many of the current target applications, a true 64-bit processor is still considered to be unnecessary. Implementation costs would be excessive, as would power and area. The ARM11 microarchitecture exploits 64-bit structures in the processor where this makes sense, without the need for a complete 64-bit solution. The result is delivery of 64-bit effective performance, but at a 32-bit cost.</p><p>The ARM11 microarchitecture specifies 64-bit data buses between the processor integer unit and the instruction and data caches, and between coprocessors and the integer unit. These 64-bit paths allow two instructions to be fetched from the cache in a single cycle, and allow load- and store-multiple instructions to transfer 64 bits (two ARM registers) every cycle. This allows ARM11 processors to achieve very high performance on many code sequences, especially those that require data movement in parallel with data processing.</p><h4>Floating Point Processing</h4><p>The ARM11 microarchitecture supports floating point as a design option. Products in development include cores with and without floating point processing units. This allows application developers to choose floating point for those applications that demand it, and to optimize cost where floating point is not required.</p><h2>ARM11 Microarchitecture Comparisons</h2><p>Figure 5 highlights some key feature comparisons between the ARM11 microarchitecture, and other currently available ARM architecture-based designs. Intel's XScale<sup>\u2122</sup> is based on the ARMv5TE architecture, which Intel licenses from ARM.</p><p>As Figure 5 illustrates, the ARM11 provides extended performance compared to the ARM9E and ARM10E, and shares many common features with the Intel XScale<sup>\u2122</sup> microarchitecture.</p><p>The key differences in pipeline details stem from the target performance range and intended implementations. ARM11 based cores target high performance, but are also intended to be easily integrated in a broad range of SoC designs. To that end, ARM11 products support a synthesis design flow, as well as semi-custom, hard-macro implementations.</p><p>The ARM11 microarchitecture also provides upward compatibility to ensure that OEMs can choose any ARM-based product, supplier, or implementation with confidence.</p>",
