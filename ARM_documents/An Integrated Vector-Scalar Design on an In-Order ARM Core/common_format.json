It has been shown that vector processors are a highly energy-efficient way to increase performance; however, adding support for them incurs area and power overheads that would not be acceptable for low-end mobile processors. In this work, we propose an integrated vector-scalar design for the ARM architecture that mostly reuses scalar hardware to support the execution of vector instructions. The key element of the design is our proposed block-based model of execution that groups vector computational instructions together to execute them in a coordinated manner. We implemented a classic vector unit and compare its results against our integrated design. Our integrated design improves the performance (more than <math>6\\times</math>) and energy consumption (up to <math>5\\times</math>) of a scalar in-order core with negligible area overhead (only <math>4.7\\%</math> when using a vector register with 32 elements). In contrast, the area overhead of the classic vector unit can be significant (around <math>44\\%</math>) if a dedicated vector floating-point unit is incorporated. Our block-based vector execution outperforms the classic vector unit for all kernels with floating-point data and also consumes less energy. We also complement the integrated design with three energy/performance-efficient techniques that further reduce power and increase performance. The first proposal covers the design and implementation of chaining logic that is optimized to work with the cache hierarchy through vector memory instructions, the second proposal reduces the number of reads/writes from/to the vector register file, and the third idea optimizes complex memory access patterns with the memory shape instruction and unified indexed vector load.</p><p>CCS Concepts: \u2022 <b>Computer systems organization</b> \u2192 <b>Single instruction, multiple data</b>;</p><p>Additional Key Words and Phrases: Vector processors, low-power, energy efficiency, mobile processors</p><h6>ACM Reference Format:</h6><p>Milan Stanic, Oscar Palomar, Timothy Hayes, Ivan Ratkovic, Adrian Cristal, Osman Unsal, and Mateo Valero. 2017.

INTRODUCTION</h2><p>In the last 15 years, power dissipation and energy consumption have become crucial design concerns for almost all computer systems for several reasons: for example, technology feature size scaling leads to higher power density and therefore to complex and costly cooling. While power dissipation is critical for high-performance systems such as data centers due to large power usage, for mobile systems, battery life is the primary concern.</p><p>Driven by this goal, researchers have focused on improving performance in an energy-efficient way. Vector processors [Asanovic 1998] are energy-efficient architectures that yield high performance whenever there is enough data-level parallelism (DLP) [Lee et al. 2011]. Besides the long and successful history of vector processors in supercomputers, vector units have been proposed in microprocessor design [Batten 2010; Espasa et al. 2002; Kozyrakis and Patterson 2003]. Recent research on vector processors shows that they can be a good match even for applications from domains such as column-store databases [Hayes et al. 2012]. Knights Landing [Sodani 2015] is a recent, second generation of the Xeon Phi processor. It is a massively parallel <math>\\times 86</math> microprocessor designed by Intel and based on the Larrabee [Seiler et al. 2009] GPU that contains a 512-bit SIMD vector processing unit in each core. Also, SIMD multimedia extensions [Firasta et al. 2008; Thakkar and Huff 1999] are often included in modern microprocessors. While vector processors and SIMD extensions both exploit DLP, they differ in the way the data operand elements are handled at the execution stage. While SIMD extensions process all elements at once, vector processors execute elements in a pipelined fashion. Although vector processors are energy efficient, they still have power and area overheads too high for mobile processors. This is mostly due to the strict power and area budget of such systems.</p><p>This article contributes a method to increase the performance of the low-power low-end embedded systems in an energy-efficient way. The energy efficiency is attained by modifying a scalar core to execute vector instructions on the existing infrastructure. In particular, we propose an integrated vector-scalar design that combines scalar and vector processing mostly using existing resources of an energy-efficient scalar processor (in our evaluation environment it is based on the ARM Cortex A7). In addition to a design that uses a conventional vector execution model, we also contribute a novel block-based model of execution for vector computational instructions. We present performance, power, area, and energy evaluation results of this integrated design. The results show that all vector designs significantly reduce energy over the scalar baseline for most of the considered kernels with a small area overhead. We report up to <math>5\\times</math> energy reduction for our block-based execution model over the scalar baseline. Additionally, we found that the block-based execution model provides better results (up to 26% of energy savings) than a conventional vector unit with dedicated units. Regarding performance gains, we report more than <math>6\\times</math> speedup compared to the scalar baseline. Moreover, our block-based execution model is up to <math>1.4\\times</math> faster than the conventional vector unit for floating-point (FP) kernels.</p><p>Additionally, we also propose three techniques for an advanced integrated design that improve energy and/or performance: (1) chaining from the memory hierarchy, (2) direct result forwarding, and (3) memory shape instructions and unified indexed vector load. We propose and implement two novel techniques that chain from the cache with the goal of further improving the performance of our integrated design. They can be applied to a conventional vector unit as well. We design and implement a novel result forwarding mechanism that complements the block-based execution and does not require writing to the vector register file. We design a vector memory unit with support for complex memory instructions including memory shape and scatter/gather instructions. Our results reveal that additional speedup (up to 20%) is achieved with</p>",

The energy efficiency is attained by modifying a scalar core to execute vector instructions on the existing infrastructure. In particular, we propose an integrated vector-scalar design that combines scalar and vector processing mostly using existing resources of an energy-efficient scalar processor (in our evaluation environment it is based on the ARM Cortex A7). In addition to a design that uses a conventional vector execution model, we also contribute a novel block-based model of execution for vector computational instructions. We present performance, power, area, and energy evaluation results of this integrated design. The results show that all vector designs significantly reduce energy over the scalar baseline for most of the considered kernels with a small area overhead. We report up to <math>5\\times</math> energy reduction for our block-based execution model over the scalar baseline. Additionally, we found that the block-based execution model provides better results (up to 26% of energy savings) than a conventional vector unit with dedicated units. Regarding performance gains, we report more than <math>6\\times</math> speedup compared to the scalar baseline. Moreover, our block-based execution model is up to <math>1.4\\times</math> faster than the conventional vector unit for floating-point (FP) kernels.</p>",

It is an in-order, dual-issue processor that implements the ARM v7 architecture with an eight-stage pipeline (nonhighlighted gray blocks in Figure 1).</p><p>In our proposed integrated vector-scalar design, we attempt to maximize the reuse of resources already present in the baseline scalar core (white blocks in Figure 1) while adding support for vector instructions. While the front end of the pipeline is the same (fetch and decode stages, with the obvious extension to the decode logic to support the new instructions), in the back end we added two structures to support the execution of vector instructions on the scalar core: a vector register file and a vector memory unit (blue blocks in Figure 1). There is also additional logic that controls the execution of vector instructions. Vector execution control logic (VECL) is added in the issue stage to support the execution of computational vector instructions. Aliasing control logic (ACL) exchanges information between the vector memory and the data cache unit and forces scalar and vector memory instructions to be executed in order. We implement support for chaining of computational instructions [Russell 1978], a well-known concept in vector processors. Similar to result forwarding in scalar processors, chaining allows starting the execution of a dependent vector instruction as soon as the first element of the vector is generated by the previous computational instruction. Chaining control logic (CCL) is responsible for the execution of chained dependent computational instructions.</p><h3>2.1. Execution of Vector Computational Instructions</h3><p>For executing the vector computational instructions on the existing scalar functional units (FUs), we study two alternatives: (1) the One-By-One model of execution (<i>OBO</i>), in essence the classic vector execution model, in which a vector instruction is executed to completion once it starts execution in a functional unit, that is, for all the operations of the vector, and (2) a novel execution model called Block-Based Execution (<i>BBE</i>). In this model, for a block of consecutive vector computational instructions, first all operations on the first element of the vectors are executed, then the operations of the second element, and so on. Figure 2 shows an illustrating example of the difference between the two execution models. For this example, we assume that vector instructions operate on FP data by using a single FP unit and a single data cache port. The first <i>vecload</i> instruction is executed in the same way and with exactly the same timing on both models, since the models refer only to computational instructions. Regarding computational vector instructions, in the first case (<i>OBO</i>, Figure 2(a)), all operations of one vector computational instruction (<i>vecadd</i>) are executed, and then we move on to the next vector instruction (<i>vecsub</i>). In the second case (<i>BBE</i>, Figure 2(b)), several consecutive vector computational instructions form a block of vector instructions, and we execute one operation from each instruction of the block and repeat this for each operation in the block of vector instructions. In the example, we execute one operation from <i>vecadd</i> and then one operation from <i>vecsub</i>. The process ends once all operations are computed. The next subsection describes the <i>BBE</i> model in more detail.</p>",

          "html": "<p>For executing the vector computational instructions on the existing scalar functional units (FUs), we study two alternatives: (1) the One-By-One model of execution (<i>OBO</i>), in essence the classic vector execution model, in which a vector instruction is executed to completion once it starts execution in a functional unit, that is, for all the operations of the vector, and (2) a novel execution model called Block-Based Execution (<i>BBE</i>). In this model, for a block of consecutive vector computational instructions, first all operations on the first element of the vectors are executed, then the operations of the second element, and so on. Figure 2 shows an illustrating example of the difference between the two execution models. For this example, we assume that vector instructions operate on FP data by using a single FP unit and a single data cache port. The first <i>vecload</i> instruction is executed in the same way and with exactly the same timing on both models, since the models refer only to computational instructions. Regarding computational vector instructions, in the first case (<i>OBO</i>, Figure 2(a)), all operations of one vector computational instruction (<i>vecadd</i>) are executed, and then we move on to the next vector instruction (<i>vecsub</i>). In the second case (<i>BBE</i>, Figure 2(b)), several consecutive vector computational instructions form a block of vector instructions, and we execute one operation from each instruction of the block and repeat this for each operation in the block of vector instructions. In the example, we execute one operation from <i>vecadd</i> and then one operation from <i>vecsub</i>. The process ends once all operations are computed. The next subsection describes the <i>BBE</i> model in more detail.</p>",

An example of vector code executed with one ALU assuming the OBO (a) and the BBE (b) model.</p></div><p block-type=\"Text\">2.1.1. Block-Based Execution. In order to support this model of execution, we added simple control logic and a small table that keeps the information of the instructions of the block. In the design presented in this article, the blocks of vector computational instructions are formed dynamically in a very simple way: once a computational vector instruction is ready for execution, the control logic examines the next instruction in the issue queue and adds it to the block if it is a vector computational instruction. This process stops when the next instruction in the issue queue is of another type (a scalar or vector memory instruction) or the block table is full.</p><p block-type=\"Text\">The number of vector instructions that can be executed in parallel or with chaining using the <i>OBO</i> model is restricted by the number of available FUs. <i>BBE</i> does not have this limitation, allowing for execution of more vector instructions in parallel. Inherently, more dependent instructions can be chained (scalar bypass logic can be reused) since one vector instruction does not occupy the ALU for all its elements in consecutive cycles, and thus it can be interleaved with other instructions using the same ALU. For example, <i>vecadd</i> and <i>vecsub</i> are not chained using the <i>OBO</i> model in Figure<a href=\"#page-3-0\"> 2</a> because there is only one FP unit, while they are executed in parallel in <i>BBE</i> even though there is only one FP unit. This approach also allows for forwarding/bypassing results to the next instruction and therefore reducing the number of reads/writes to the vector register file as shown in Section<a href=\"#page-19-0\"> 5.2.</a> An important advantage of <i>BBE</i> over <i>OBO</i> or a classic vector unit is the following: while a block of vector computational instructions is under execution, <i>BBE</i> allows for the execution of subsequent scalar or vector memory instructions if they are ready for execution and there are free functional units that can execute them. In Figure<a href=\"#page-3-0\"> 2(</a>b), the second <i>vecload</i> instruction can start execution just after the <i>vecsub</i> started with execution of the first operation. Evaluation of kernels with FP data in Section<a href=\"#page-7-0\"> 3.1</a> also clearly shows the advantage of <i>BBE</i> over <i>OBO</i> or the classic vector unit.</p>",

In order to support this model of execution, we added simple control logic and a small table that keeps the information of the instructions of the block. In the design presented in this article, the blocks of vector computational instructions are formed dynamically in a very simple way: once a computational vector instruction is ready for execution, the control logic examines the next instruction in the issue queue and adds it to the block if it is a vector computational instruction. This process stops when the next instruction in the issue queue is of another type (a scalar or vector memory instruction) or the block table is full.</p>",

Inherently, more dependent instructions can be chained (scalar bypass logic can be reused) since one vector instruction does not occupy the ALU for all its elements in consecutive cycles, and thus it can be interleaved with other instructions using the same ALU. For example, <i>vecadd</i> and <i>vecsub</i> are not chained using the <i>OBO</i> model in Figure<a href=\"#page-3-0\"> 2</a> because there is only one FP unit, while they are executed in parallel in <i>BBE</i> even though there is only one FP unit. This approach also allows for forwarding/bypassing results to the next instruction and therefore reducing the number of reads/writes to the vector register file as shown in Section<a href=\"#page-19-0\"> 5.2.</a> An important advantage of <i>BBE</i> over <i>OBO</i> or a classic vector unit is the following: while a block of vector computational instructions is under execution, <i>BBE</i> allows for the execution of subsequent scalar or vector memory instructions if they are ready for execution and there are free functional units that can execute them. In Figure<a href=\"#page-3-0\"> 2(</a>b), the second <i>vecload</i> instruction can start execution just after the <i>vecsub</i> started with execution of the first operation. Evaluation of kernels with FP data in Section<a href=\"#page-7-0\"> 3.1</a> also clearly shows the advantage of <i>BBE</i> over <i>OBO</i> or the classic vector unit.</p>",

Vector memory unit.</p><p><i>BBE</i> has some drawbacks: the number of vector computational instructions dynamically included in a block is sensitive to the placement of the vector instructions inside vectorized code. Smaller blocks present fewer opportunities for forwarding/bypassing that can be achieved with longer blocks. To keep the design simple, in this article, the implementation does not allow overlapping of execution between two consecutive blocks, which is a potential solution to alleviate this problem. This means that the first block needs to finish execution before the second block can start. Another limitation is that dealing with multicycle instructions and especially groups of dependent instructions with different latencies inside a block requires additional control logic support. In our model, we support execution of multicycle instructions as well as execution of dependent instructions with different latencies, but restricted to the case where they are executed on different ALUs. The benefit of <i>BBE</i> can be further increased if we can chain vector memory instructions in an efficient way. The next section describes the vector memory unit of the proposed system, and Section 4.1 presents our proposal to implement chaining from the memory hierarchy.</p><h3>2.2. Vector Memory Unit</h3><p>The vector memory unit holds and controls the execution of vector memory instructions. There are two tables that hold the necessary information to execute vector memory instructions, as shown in Figure 3. The vector memory instruction table (VMIT) keeps information for each instruction (instruction, start address, stride, number of elements, current element, and number of completed operations). The vector memory control table (VMCT) controls the exchange of packets with the L1 cache. Each entry in this table has the following fields: instruction ID, packet/request ID, and a valid bit. Additional fields are used to identify the corresponding element(s) of the source/destination vector register.</p><p>The address generator (AG) performs the address generation for vector memory instructions. The information about the instruction stored in the VMIT, namely, the opcode, start address, stride, number of elements, and current element, is enough to generate all requests to the cache hierarchy. We can decode the type of vector memory instruction (unit-strided, strided, or indexed) and destination/source register from the instruction opcode field. The stride field can hold the stride for strided memory instructions or the ID of a vector register that holds the index vector for indexed memory instructions. We load/store whole cache lines for unit-stride vector memory instructions with a single access.</p><p>ACL controls the proper execution of vector and scalar memory instructions. In our model, we support a very simple aliasing policy to limit the complexity of the control logic: scalar loads wait until all older vector stores finish and vector loads wait until all older scalar stores finish. We provide more architecture-level details in the next subsection regarding the additional control logic.</p><h3>2.3. Implementation</h3><p>As explained in Section 2, we added the control logic to support execution of vector instructions (VECL, ACL, CCL). We first describe the hardware implementation to</p>",

          "html": "<p><i>BBE</i> has some drawbacks: the number of vector computational instructions dynamically included in a block is sensitive to the placement of the vector instructions inside vectorized code. Smaller blocks present fewer opportunities for forwarding/bypassing that can be achieved with longer blocks. To keep the design simple, in this article, the implementation does not allow overlapping of execution between two consecutive blocks, which is a potential solution to alleviate this problem. This means that the first block needs to finish execution before the second block can start. Another limitation is that dealing with multicycle instructions and especially groups of dependent instructions with different latencies inside a block requires additional control logic support. In our model, we support execution of multicycle instructions as well as execution of dependent instructions with different latencies, but restricted to the case where they are executed on different ALUs.

We augmented the multiplexers (MUX1 and MUX2) on each input of the ALUs to select the input from the scalar or the vector register files. Each multiplexer has two additional inputs: the first one (labelled as ALU2) comes from the output of the second ALU and is present in the scalar design for bypassing, but we use it also for chaining of vector computational instructions and direct forwarding (see Section 4.2); the second input (memory) is related to the possible implementation of direct forwarding from the vector memory instructions (see Section 4.2); however, it would be present already in the scalar design if it implements bypassing from memory instructions. There are also two multiplexers (MUX3 and MUX4) at the input of the write ports (W) in the scalar and vector register files in order to write a result from the appropriate source (an output of one of the ALUs or data loaded from the memory hierarchy). We need control signals for each of the multiplexers. Figure 4 shows the required hardware for a single ALU. VECL also contains control logic including a counter and a comparator that tracks how many elements of a vector computational instruction have been processed and compares the current counter value with the VL register.</p><p>Regarding ACL, we added two registers in LSQ and VMU that point to entries of the oldest scalar and vector loads, respectively, and one comparator to compare scalar loads with the oldest vector store and vector loads with the oldest scalar store.

INTEGRATED DESIGN EVALUATION</h2><p>We extended the gem5 simulator [Binkert et al. 2011] to model an in-order ARM core, a classic vector unit (CVU), and our two models of execution: OBO and BBE.

Each multiplexer has two additional inputs: the first one (labelled as ALU2) comes from the output of the second ALU and is present in the scalar design for bypassing, but we use it also for chaining of vector computational instructions and direct forwarding (see Section 4.2); the second input (memory) is related to the possible implementation of direct forwarding from the vector memory instructions (see Section 4.2); however, it would be present already in the scalar design if it implements bypassing from memory instructions. There are also two multiplexers (MUX3 and MUX4) at the input of the write ports (W) in the scalar and vector register files in order to write a result from the appropriate source (an output of one of the ALUs or data loaded from the memory hierarchy). We need control signals for each of the multiplexers. Figure 4 shows the required hardware for a single ALU. VECL also contains control logic including a counter and a comparator that tracks how many elements of a vector computational instruction have been processed and compares the current counter value with the VL register.</p>",

There are still some differences that are discussed in Section 6. Simulations are performed using system call emulation mode.</p><p>Table I summarizes the microarchitectural parameters used in our experiments. CVU has two additional integer ALUs (one simple and one complex) and one FP ALU to execute vector computational instructions. The vector register file has 16 vector registers. We use four different maximum vector lengths (MVLs): 16, 32, 64, and 128 elements, with 32 being the default length. Gem5's model of the bus between the CPU and the L1 data cache is extended to model bandwidth and bus contention. We used 16 bytes for the bus width. L2 bus bandwidth is one cache line per cycle. The L2 also has a simple strided hardware prefetcher. OBO has a similar configuration to CVU except it uses scalar ALUs to execute vector computational instructions. Broadcast logic (including the broadcast bus) is also different. The differences between OBO and BBE are a table that holds vector computational instructions (four instructions) for BBE and logic that controls execution of vector computational instructions. We used a latency of one cycle for all instructions that use the simple int ALU, three cycles for the complex int ALU, and four cycles for all instructions that use the FP ALU.</p><p>We modified McPAT [Li et al. 2009] to evaluate the power, energy, and area of these microarchitecture variants. We modeled additional structures using the same approach and borrowing the parameters from existing structures in McPAT or CACTI if suitable. For example, in order to model a decoder for chaining logic from the memory hierarchy, we use a decoder from the decode stage with new parameters (e.g., number of bits to compare). We assume a 40nm technology for an embedded processor with low operating power for energy, power, and area evaluation.</p><p>Table II lists the kernels that are used to evaluate our design: saxpy microkernel, the three most time-consuming kernels from Sphinx3, one from H264ref, one from Hmmer, one from Facerec, and one from Graph500. The first three benchmarks are from the SPEC2006 benchmark suite. We have chosen these applications because they represent typical mobile applications: Sphinx3 performs speech recognition, H264ref does video coding, and Hmmer features hidden Markov models that are used in machine learning. Facerec is from the SPEC2000 benchmark suite. Even though SPEC benchmarks are typically used to evaluate general-purpose processors, applications</p>",

Speedup for <i>CVU</i>, <i>OBO</i>, and <i>BBE</i> over the scalar baseline.</p><p>such as speech recognition or face recognition are widely used in mobiles. For example, Facerec contains FFT computation\u2014a kernel found in the EEMBC benchmark suite [Weiss 1999]. The saxpy microkernel is not as representative of mobile workloads, but we chose it as a paradigmatic example of a vectorized kernel. Moreover, its simplicity and characteristics help to reason about the results. The Graph500 [Murphy et al. 2010] benchmark is a data-intensive, high-performance graph-processing application, but we choose this application because it is highly cache unfriendly and it is a good example to evaluate our ideas for cache-unfriendly scenarios. The vectorization potential of the Graph500 was evaluated by Stanic et al. [2014]. <i>sphinx-a</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, and <i>facerec</i> operate on FP data, while the rest of the kernels use integers. Table II also presents characteristics for each kernel. Our eight kernels exploit several different memory access patterns. Four kernels have a unit-stride, <i>sphinx-a</i> and <i>facerec</i> have strided, and <i>sphinx-c</i> and <i>graph500</i> have indexed memory access patterns. The ratio between computational and memory instructions varies across kernels, as does the number of vector instructions inside a vectorized loop. Kernels also have different loop counts. There are kernels with very short loop counts (<i>sphinx-c</i>,<sup>1</sup> <i>facerec</i>,<sup>2</sup> <i>h264ref</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, and <i>graph500</i><sup>3</sup>) and kernels with longer loop counts (<i>sphinx-a</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, and <i>hmmr</i>). The last column shows the ratio between vector and scalar operations. Most of the kernels have a high percentage of operations executed from vector instructions (<i>sphinx-a</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, and <i>facerec</i>), <i>sphinx-c</i>, <i>hmmr</i>, and <i>graph500</i> have between 66% and 80% of all operations executed in vector instructions, while <i>h264ref</i> is the only kernel with dominant scalar operations (around 66%). We tried to cover as many scenarios and aspects as possible with these eight kernels. We extracted the input data from the applications when running the ref input dataset and used them to initialize the data structures before simulation. We extended the ARM ISA with a set of 27 vector instructions that we used to vectorize the kernels.</p><h3>3.1. Performance Evaluation</h3><p>Figure 5 shows the speedups for <i>CVU</i>, <i>OBO</i>, and <i>BBE</i> over the scalar baseline for all kernels. As expected, <i>CVU</i> outperforms the integrated designs (<i>OBO</i> and <i>BBE</i>) for integer data (<i>sphinx-c</i>, <i>h264ref</i>, <i>hmmr</i>, and <i>graph500</i>) because it has two additional ALUs for computational vector instructions, while ALUs are shared between scalar and vector computational instructions in the integrated designs. In the vectorized loops, there are still many scalar instructions for bookkeeping, which then interfere with</p><p><sup>1</sup>This is the average vector length for all iterations.

For example, Facerec contains FFT computation\u2014a kernel found in the EEMBC benchmark suite [Weiss 1999]. The saxpy microkernel is not as representative of mobile workloads, but we chose it as a paradigmatic example of a vectorized kernel. Moreover, its simplicity and characteristics help to reason about the results. The Graph500 [Murphy et al. 2010] benchmark is a data-intensive, high-performance graph-processing application, but we choose this application because it is highly cache unfriendly and it is a good example to evaluate our ideas for cache-unfriendly scenarios. The vectorization potential of the Graph500 was evaluated by Stanic et al. [2014]. <i>sphinx-a</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, and <i>facerec</i> operate on FP data, while the rest of the kernels use integers. Table II also presents characteristics for each kernel. Our eight kernels exploit several different memory access patterns. Four kernels have a unit-stride, <i>sphinx-a</i> and <i>facerec</i> have strided, and <i>sphinx-c</i> and <i>graph500</i> have indexed memory access patterns. The ratio between computational and memory instructions varies across kernels, as does the number of vector instructions inside a vectorized loop. Kernels also have different loop counts. There are kernels with very short loop counts (<i>sphinx-c</i>,<sup>1</sup> <i>facerec</i>,<sup>2</sup> <i>h264ref</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, and <i>graph500</i><sup>3</sup>) and kernels with longer loop counts (<i>sphinx-a</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, and <i>hmmr</i>). The last column shows the ratio between vector and scalar operations. Most of the kernels have a high percentage of operations executed from vector instructions (<i>sphinx-a</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, and <i>facerec</i>), <i>sphinx-c</i>, <i>hmmr</i>, and <i>graph500</i> have between 66% and 80% of all operations executed in vector instructions, while <i>h264ref</i> is the only kernel with dominant scalar operations (around 66%). We tried to cover as many scenarios and aspects as possible with these eight kernels. We extracted the input data from the applications when running the ref input dataset and used them to initialize the data structures before simulation. We extended the ARM ISA with a set of 27 vector instructions that we used to vectorize the kernels.</p>",

The integrated designs provide good speedup over the scalar baseline for <i>hmmr</i> and <i>graph500</i>, while there is little speedup over the scalar for <i>sphinx-c</i>. The main reasons are the use of index memory accesses, the small amount of computational vector instructions, and the short vector lengths for the majority of iterations. <i>h264ref</i> is an example where vectorization is inefficient. We obtained a slowdown over the scalar for all vector models. Despite this kernel having a short vector length (only 16), the main reason for slowdown is that in order to vectorize this kernel, we require twice the computational operations as the scalar version.</p><p>Regarding the FP kernels, the vector models are always faster than the scalar baseline. Speedups for <i>saxpy</i> are extremely high. It is a very simple kernel with a unit-strided memory access pattern and highly regular DLP. A whole cache line can be accessed with one access (16 elements per access), and for this particular experiment the input dataset fits into L1 cache. <i>sphinx-a</i> and <i>sphinx-b</i> have decent speedups. <i>sphinx-a</i> uses strided vector memory instructions to load data from the cache, which prevents reaching higher speedups. <i>sphinx-b</i> uses unit-stride vector memory instructions, but it is limited by the number of iterations of the original scalar loop that has been vectorized (only 32 iterations). <i>facerec</i> has the smallest speedup and the main reasons are the presence of strided memory accesses and a short vector length in most cases (only four or eight). <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> have the same execution time (a consequence of having a single FP unit), while <i>BBE</i> outperforms them due to the advantage of executing subsequent integer scalar (loop overhead instructions) or vector memory instructions in parallel with the current block of vector computational instructions. In-order execution blocks the vector instructions and subsequent instructions in <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, but this does not happen in <i>BBE</i>, as shown in Figure 2. This difference is especially noticeable for <i>sphinx-a</i>, where the speedup for <i>BBE</i> over <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> is around <math>1.4\\times</math> for all MVLS. <i>sphinx-b</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, and <i>facerec</i> exploit this advantage from <i>BBE</i> execution inside a single iteration of a vectorized loop, while <i>sphinx-a</i> is a kind of kernel that is able to exploit this across multiple iterations. There is often vector memory store instructions at the end of a vectorized loop (<i>sphinx-b</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, and <i>facerec</i>). This instruction needs to wait until all elements of a vector source register are computed before it starts with execution. Then we can proceed with the next iteration. <i>sphinx-a</i> does not have a vector memory store instruction in the inner loop, and it is able to overlap execution of a vector load instruction in the next iteration with vector computational instructions in the previous iteration. For this particular case, vector computational instructions are completely overlapped with vector memory instructions across all iterations of the inner loop, yielding significant speedup of <i>BBE</i> over <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>. Table III shows how often we are able to start earlier with vector load execution in <i>BBE</i> compared to <i>OBO</i> for FP kernels. Almost all vector loads in <i>sphinx-a</i> can start execution earlier in <i>BBE</i>, and we have significant speedup for <i>sphinx-a</i> as a direct consequence. <i>Sphinx-b</i> and <i>facerec</i> have around one-third of all vector loads that can start earlier execution in <i>BBE</i>, while scalar loop bookkeeping instructions are</p>",

It is a very simple kernel with a unit-strided memory access pattern and highly regular DLP. A whole cache line can be accessed with one access (16 elements per access), and for this particular experiment the input dataset fits into L1 cache. <i>sphinx-a</i> and <i>sphinx-b</i> have decent speedups. <i>sphinx-a</i> uses strided vector memory instructions to load data from the cache, which prevents reaching higher speedups. <i>sphinx-b</i> uses unit-stride vector memory instructions, but it is limited by the number of iterations of the original scalar loop that has been vectorized (only 32 iterations). <i>facerec</i> has the smallest speedup and the main reasons are the presence of strided memory accesses and a short vector length in most cases (only four or eight). <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> have the same execution time (a consequence of having a single FP unit), while <i>BBE</i> outperforms them due to the advantage of executing subsequent integer scalar (loop overhead instructions) or vector memory instructions in parallel with the current block of vector computational instructions. In-order execution blocks the vector instructions and subsequent instructions in <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, but this does not happen in <i>BBE</i>, as shown in Figure 2. This difference is especially noticeable for <i>sphinx-a</i>, where the speedup for <i>BBE</i> over <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> is around <math>1.4\\times</math> for all MVLS. <i>sphinx-b</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, and <i>facerec</i> exploit this advantage from <i>BBE</i> execution inside a single iteration of a vectorized loop, while <i>sphinx-a</i> is a kind of kernel that is able to exploit this across multiple iterations. There is often vector memory store instructions at the end of a vectorized loop (<i>sphinx-b</i>, <i>saxpy</i>, and <i>facerec</i>). This instruction needs to wait until all elements of a vector source register are computed before it starts with execution. Then we can proceed with the next iteration. <i>sphinx-a</i> does not have a vector memory store instruction in the inner loop, and it is able to overlap execution of a vector load instruction in the next iteration with vector computational instructions in the previous iteration. For this particular case, vector computational instructions are completely overlapped with vector memory instructions across all iterations of the inner loop, yielding significant speedup of <i>BBE</i> over <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>. Table III shows how often we are able to start earlier with vector load execution in <i>BBE</i> compared to <i>OBO</i> for FP kernels. Almost all vector loads in <i>sphinx-a</i> can start execution earlier in <i>BBE</i>, and we have significant speedup for <i>sphinx-a</i> as a direct consequence. <i>Sphinx-b</i> and <i>facerec</i> have around one-third of all vector loads that can start earlier execution in <i>BBE</i>, while scalar loop bookkeeping instructions are</p>",

Further increasing MVL to 64 is beneficial for sphinx-b, saxpy, hmmer, and graph500, while vector registers with 128 elements only provide marginal speedup for sphinx-a and saxpy. sphinx-b cannot exploit the benefits of MVLs beyond 32 because the vectorized loop has only 32 iterations. sphinx-c is limited by short loop counts and does not scale with longer MVLs.</p><p block-type=\"Text\">We also analyzed the sensitivity to the latency of vector arithmetic instructions. We used four different latencies for vector arithmetic FP instructions: four, five, six, and eight cycles. If we increase latency from four to eight cycles, speedup over the scalar baseline decreases by 5.9% using MVL 16 in sphinx-a, while this number is only 1.1% of MVL 128.

Results are stacked for vector models using four different MVLs. OBO and BBE have slightly lower dynamic power than CVU, while BBE has the highest dynamic power for sphinx-a. This is a direct consequence of the speedup achieved with BBE over CVU and OBO (Figure 5) combined with its not-so-large reduction of consumed energy (Figure 6). For the rest of the kernels, this difference is smaller and we observed that the most power-consuming model changes with the MVL. OBO and BBE also have lower dynamic power than the scalar baseline for sphinx-c and facerec for all MVLs and sphinx-b with shorter MVLs (16 and 32) due to significant savings in the front end of the processor (instruction fetch and dispatch).</p><p>This evaluation indicates that if only performance is important and only integer data is used, then CVU should be chosen. For mobile devices, in which power and area are of the utmost importance, one of our proposed integrated models is a good match. For FP kernels, our BBE model is clearly the best choice from the performance, area, and energy consumption perspectives.</p><h2>4. ENHANCEMENT OF INTEGRATED DESIGN</h2><p>In this section, we present three techniques that improve the basic integrated design presented and evaluated in previous sections. The techniques have negligible area overhead and increase performance or reduce energy and/or power with respect to the basic integrated design. The first technique covers the design and implementation of chaining logic that is optimized to work with the cache hierarchy through vector memory instructions, the second technique reduces number of reads/writes to/from the vector register file, and in the third technique we propose two vector memory instructions: memory shape instruction and unified indexed vector load. We combined techniques in the evaluation whenever it has sense. For example, we studied the interaction of other techniques with the chaining from the memory hierarchy.</p><h3>4.1. Chaining from the Memory Hierarchy</h3><p>Chaining from vector memory instructions was a feature typically implemented in classic vector supercomputers [Russell 1978; Sch\u00f6nauer 1987]. In those systems, the vector processor accessed main memory directly. The lack of a cache hierarchy made memory access time completely predictable, so given an instruction, it was simple to determine exactly in which cycle every element would arrive from memory. Therefore, additional control logic to support chaining from vector memory instructions did not</p>",

An example of how to update the <i>lastWritten</i> register for chaining from the memory hierarchy.<p>require substantial resources. The issues arose with vector microprocessors with a cache hierarchy. Due to the nature of the cache hierarchy and cache misses, it was difficult to predict when the requested data would arrive from the cache. Processor architects considered that supporting chaining from the memory hierarchy is expensive and required complex control logic and did not implement this feature in vector microprocessors (e.g., Kozyrakis and Patterson [2003]).</p><p>We consider that chaining from cache can be particularly fruitful for our <i>BBE</i> model due to the opportunity to chain a larger number of vector arithmetic instructions in a block. Therefore, we decided to design and evaluate support for this feature. However, this technique works not only for <i>BBE</i> but also for <i>OBO</i> and <i>CVU</i>. Figure 8 shows the logic and structures we propose to allow chaining from the memory hierarchy to a dependent instruction. The main idea is to track the last written element (<i>lastWritten</i>) of the vector register and use it in the <i>VECL</i> (the Vector Execution Control Logic, as explained in Section 2). Then, the <i>VECL</i> can determine if the current vector operation is ready for execution, simply by comparing the last written element and the current operation (<i>currElem</i>): if <i>lastWritten</i> is greater than or equal to <i>currElem</i>, then <i>VECL</i> can execute the current vector operation. Otherwise, it needs to wait until <i>currElem</i> is written in the vector register and <i>lastWritten</i> updated. The most complex operation of this design is updating the <i>lastWritten</i> register. Due to the presence of caches, the elements of a vector load can arrive out of order to the vector register, so we need to track all elements that have arrived. To this purpose, we added a bitmap. The size of the bitmap is equal to the <i>MVL</i> of the vector registers. In order to decode which element is written, a decoder is added. Subsequently, a priority encoder is used to determine the new value of the <i>lastWritten</i> register: the position of an element in the vector register, in which all prior elements are written already, as well as itself, and its immediate successor is not written yet.</p><p>Figure 9 illustrates an example of how the <i>lastWritten</i> register is updated. Current state is presented in Figure 9(a). The <i>lastWritten</i> register has value two because, as</p>",

This <math>mvl</math> value is used to index the <i>Bit_map_of_written_elems</i> register. The output of the <i>Bit_map_of_written_elems</i> register is input to the <i>Priority encoder</i>.

          "html": "<p>We consider that chaining from cache can be particularly fruitful for our <i>BBE</i> model due to the opportunity to chain a larger number of vector arithmetic instructions in a block. Therefore, we decided to design and evaluate support for this feature. However, this technique works not only for <i>BBE</i> but also for <i>OBO</i> and <i>CVU</i>. Figure 8 shows the logic and structures we propose to allow chaining from the memory hierarchy to a dependent instruction. The main idea is to track the last written element (<i>lastWritten</i>) of the vector register and use it in the <i>VECL</i> (the Vector Execution Control Logic, as explained in Section 2). Then, the <i>VECL</i> can determine if the current vector operation is ready for execution, simply by comparing the last written element and the current operation (<i>currElem</i>): if <i>lastWritten</i> is greater than or equal to <i>currElem</i>, then <i>VECL</i> can execute the current vector operation. Otherwise, it needs to wait until <i>currElem</i> is written in the vector register and <i>lastWritten</i> updated. The most complex operation of this design is updating the <i>lastWritten</i> register. Due to the presence of caches, the elements of a vector load can arrive out of order to the vector register, so we need to track all elements that have arrived. To this purpose, we added a bitmap. The size of the bitmap is equal to the <i>MVL</i> of the vector registers. In order to decode which element is written, a decoder is added. Subsequently, a priority encoder is used to determine the new value of the <i>lastWritten</i> register: the position of an element in the vector register, in which all prior elements are written already, as well as itself, and its immediate successor is not written yet.</p>",

The decoded value is 00100000 and the corresponding element in the bitmap is set to one (the light gray box). Then the content of the bitmap is sent to the input of the priority encoder.

The chaining control logic needs to know if it will track the last written element for a vector load, that is, if there is any dependent computational vector instruction that is ready for execution. Since there is a time window to resolve if there is any ready dependent instruction between the moment a vector load starts execution and the moment the first element arrives to the destination vector register, we decided to use this as a requirement to apply chaining from memory. This means that a dependent instruction will be chained only if it is in the issue queue and ready for execution before the first element arrives to the vector register. Otherwise, the dependent instruction stalls until the vector load is completed, just like in the basic design without support for chaining from the memory hierarchy.</p><h3>4.2. Direct Forwarding</h3><p>While vectorizing the kernels, we realized that there are cases in which data are computed and then used only once. Figure 10 shows an example from the Sphinx3 kernel. Instruction <i>vecsubsv</i> stores the result of its computation in vector register <i>VR4</i> and only the subsequent instruction <i>vecmul</i> uses it as the input operand. The scenario is the same for vector registers <i>VR5</i> and <i>VR6</i>. They are only used once as input operands by subsequent instructions. Therefore, if these instructions are chained and we can take advantage of the fact that they are read only once, we could save three <math>\\times</math> VL writes and four <math>\\times</math> VL reads to/from the vector register file in this particular example. We are saving two reads in the first <i>vecmul</i> instruction, both for vector register <i>VR4</i>. Moreover, by forwarding from vector memory instructions, we could avoid writes and reads to vector registers <i>VR2</i> and <i>VR3</i> as well. It means that we would need only to read data from vector register <i>VR7</i> and to write the final result there.</p><p>To further analyze the potential applicability for result forwarding without writing to the vector register file (direct forwarding), we examined all vectorized kernels with the <i>BBE</i> model of execution in mind. Table V shows how many vector registers are read or written per iteration (we just counted one access per vector register of each</p>",

Otherwise, the dependent instruction stalls until the vector load is completed, just like in the basic design without support for chaining from the memory hierarchy.</p>",

Numbers for vector register reads and writes are counted for the configuration of the functional units presented in Table I with enabled chaining for vector computational instructions. They are the same for all three models of execution. Numbers related to direct forwarding are counted for <i>BBE</i>. Numbers related to direct forwarding show that we can reduce the number of reads and writes by more than two for <i>sphinx-a</i>, <i>sphinx-b</i>, and <i>hmmr</i>, but there are also kernels that cannot benefit from this technique.</p><p>Since there is already logic for scalar result forwarding/bypassing, we decided to reuse it with small additional logic that will allow for direct forwarding. The key idea is to somehow identify if the result of an instruction is used in only one subsequent instruction. In many situations, the compiler can relatively easily identify the case when a value is used only once. The second part is annotation of identified instructions. One solution to annotate the instruction is to reserve a bit in encoding for vector computational instructions (e.g., a bit set to one). Forwarding logic detects if the bit is set to one and forwards results to the corresponding FU without writing to the vector register. The consequence of this approach is that the ISA must be extended to allow for annotating of vector instructions.</p><p>Direct forwarding can be applied to all three models\u2014<i>CVU</i>, <i>OBO</i>, and <i>BBE</i>\u2014but it is much more suitable for <i>BBE</i> because it allows for execution of a larger number of vector computational instructions in parallel, and therefore, it increases the benefit of direct forwarding. In <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, it is only useful for chained instructions, which depends on the number and types of the instructions executed.</p><h3>4.3. Vector Memory Shape Instruction</h3><p>Even though <i>facerec</i> is highly vectorizable, we did not obtain high speedups (up to <math>1.77\\times</math> for <i>BBE</i>). The main reason is that it has a complex memory access pattern to a matrix. Elements are loaded from the matrix using three memory access patterns that are repeated in a cyclic fashion. Each memory pattern loads 64 elements. In the first pattern, 64 elements are loaded using a single strided vector memory load instruction with stride two. In the second pattern, we need four strided vector load instructions with stride two to load all 64 elements, while in the third pattern, we need 16 instructions (each one loads only four elements). We realized that there is a regularity in the accesses for the second and third case that cannot be expressed with strided memory instructions, but it would be possible to load all the elements by providing a more complex vector memory instruction that supports this pattern: the \u201cvector memory shape instruction\u201d (<i>vmshape</i>) [Ciricescu et al. 2003]. <i>vmshape</i> uses a base address and three scalar values, stride, span, and skip, to describe a vector. Stride has the same role as in strided vector memory instructions (spacing between each accessed element). Span describes how many elements to access at stride spacing before applying the second-level skip offset. Memory shape instructions can be called 2D strided vector memory instructions because they are an extension of stride instructions to 2D patterns.</p><p>In order to support the execution of <i>vmshape</i>, we slightly modified the vector memory unit (Figure 3). VMIT is extended with span (8 bits), skip (32 bits), and a field that counts the number of elements before skip is applied (8 bits). An additional circuitry</p>",

The key idea is to somehow identify if the result of an instruction is used in only one subsequent instruction. In many situations, the compiler can relatively easily identify the case when a value is used only once. The second part is annotation of identified instructions. One solution to annotate the instruction is to reserve a bit in encoding for vector computational instructions (e.g., a bit set to one). Forwarding logic detects if the bit is set to one and forwards results to the corresponding FU without writing to the vector register. The consequence of this approach is that the ISA must be extended to allow for annotating of vector instructions.</p>",

The main reason is that it has a complex memory access pattern to a matrix. Elements are loaded from the matrix using three memory access patterns that are repeated in a cyclic fashion. Each memory pattern loads 64 elements. In the first pattern, 64 elements are loaded using a single strided vector memory load instruction with stride two. In the second pattern, we need four strided vector load instructions with stride two to load all 64 elements, while in the third pattern, we need 16 instructions (each one loads only four elements). We realized that there is a regularity in the accesses for the second and third case that cannot be expressed with strided memory instructions, but it would be possible to load all the elements by providing a more complex vector memory instruction that supports this pattern: the \u201cvector memory shape instruction\u201d (<i>vmshape</i>) [Ciricescu et al. 2003]. <i>vmshape</i> uses a base address and three scalar values, stride, span, and skip, to describe a vector. Stride has the same role as in strided vector memory instructions (spacing between each accessed element). Span describes how many elements to access at stride spacing before applying the second-level skip offset. Memory shape instructions can be called 2D strided vector memory instructions because they are an extension of stride instructions to 2D patterns.</p>",

Unified Indexed Vector Load</h3><p>We achieved decent speedup for graph500 even though it is data-intensive, cache-unfriendly application. In the first part of the BFS kernel, the algorithm loads all neighboring nodes of the current node and checks if they are visited. In the current implementation, we used three vector instructions to perform this task: (1) unit-stride vector load gets indices, (2) indexed vector load gets neighboring nodes, and (3) compare vector-scalar instruction checks if they are already visited. The indices are used directly by the second load. Since we already implemented chaining from memory instructions, we wanted to study how much graph500 would benefit from merging the two load instructions. The idea is to have a single instruction and, once we receive data from the data cache for indices (index values), automatically initiate corresponding accesses for the indexed vector load instruction (operations that correspond to loaded indices\u2014final values). Loading an array and using it as index vector is also used in other applications (i.e., Sphinx3).</p><p>The desired scenario, in which the unified indexed load would be more useful, would be if one of the requests of the unit-stride vector load hits the L1 data cache and the corresponding elements of the indexed vector load miss the L1 data cache. We profiled graph500 using 3,000 nodes and 50,000 edges as input parameters and three different cache configurations: small (L1 8KB and L2 128KB), medium (L1 16KB and L2 256KB), and big (L1 32KB and L2 256KB). Our findings were that the unit-stride vector load misses a lot for all cache sizes (two-thirds of all requests miss the L1 data cache), while the miss rate for the indexed vector load depends on the number of nodes and cache size (as Table VI shows). In this particular case, we will receive earlier values for the indexed vector load compared to the current implementation where the indexed vector load needs to wait until the unit-stride vector load is finished. Figure 11 shows a simplified example of how elements are loaded from the memory system using the unit-stride and indexed vector load (a) and the unified vector load (b). Requests to load indices (with a sequential pattern) are blue squares, and loaded indices (with) are blue circles. Requests to load final values (with an indexed pattern) are red squares, and loaded final values are red circles. Let's assume that we have the desired scenario for the second element: the request for the index value hits in the L1, while the request for the final value misses in the L1. The basic approach that uses separated unit-stride and indexed vector load (Figure 11(a)) cannot start sending requests for final values until all index values are loaded, while in the case of the unified vector load, requests for final values initiate immediately after the index values are received (Figure 11(b)). Therefore, we can see in the presented example that the second final value is loaded much earlier using the unified vector load as well as all final values. If we assume that a hit to L1 is four and miss 12 cycles, all elements will be loaded in 33 cycles in the first case, while we will need 22 cycles with the unified vector load. We</p>",

In the first part of the BFS kernel, the algorithm loads all neighboring nodes of the current node and checks if they are visited. In the current implementation, we used three vector instructions to perform this task: (1) unit-stride vector load gets indices, (2) indexed vector load gets neighboring nodes, and (3) compare vector-scalar instruction checks if they are already visited. The indices are used directly by the second load. Since we already implemented chaining from memory instructions, we wanted to study how much graph500 would benefit from merging the two load instructions. The idea is to have a single instruction and, once we receive data from the data cache for indices (index values), automatically initiate corresponding accesses for the indexed vector load instruction (operations that correspond to loaded indices\u2014final values). Loading an array and using it as index vector is also used in other applications (i.e., Sphinx3).</p>",

We profiled graph500 using 3,000 nodes and 50,000 edges as input parameters and three different cache configurations: small (L1 8KB and L2 128KB), medium (L1 16KB and L2 256KB), and big (L1 32KB and L2 256KB). Our findings were that the unit-stride vector load misses a lot for all cache sizes (two-thirds of all requests miss the L1 data cache), while the miss rate for the indexed vector load depends on the number of nodes and cache size (as Table VI shows). In this particular case, we will receive earlier values for the indexed vector load compared to the current implementation where the indexed vector load needs to wait until the unit-stride vector load is finished. Figure 11 shows a simplified example of how elements are loaded from the memory system using the unit-stride and indexed vector load (a) and the unified vector load (b). Requests to load indices (with a sequential pattern) are blue squares, and loaded indices (with) are blue circles. Requests to load final values (with an indexed pattern) are red squares, and loaded final values are red circles. Let's assume that we have the desired scenario for the second element: the request for the index value hits in the L1, while the request for the final value misses in the L1. The basic approach that uses separated unit-stride and indexed vector load (Figure 11(a)) cannot start sending requests for final values until all index values are loaded, while in the case of the unified vector load, requests for final values initiate immediately after the index values are received (Figure 11(b)). Therefore, we can see in the presented example that the second final value is loaded much earlier using the unified vector load as well as all final values. If we assume that a hit to L1 is four and miss 12 cycles, all elements will be loaded in 33 cycles in the first case, while we will need 22 cycles with the unified vector load. We</p>",

An example that shows execution of (a) unit-stride and indexed vector load and (b) unified vector load.</p><p>further profiled graph500 and we found that there is always at least one request inside the unit-stride vector load that hits the L1 data cache. We can start with indexed load accesses for those cases while waiting for the rest. Our profiling results were promising and we decided to implement unified indexed vector load instructions (see Section 5.4).</p><p>We had several dilemmas regarding the implementation of unified indexed vector load instructions. The initial idea was to add hardware that detects packets with indices (with the unit-stride vector load), buffer them, and initiate accesses for the indexed vector load at the cache side. We realized that it would need to communicate with the TLB in some cases (e.g., if the index value is higher than the TLB page size) in order to perform the address translation. We also realized that the indexed vector loaded by unit-stride vector load is often used by several subsequent vector instructions and that we will still need to transfer those values to the vector register file. Therefore, we decided to move the additional hardware to the vector memory unit (see Section 2.2), where most of the existing hardware can be reused to support execution of a unified indexed vector load. If the index values are just used in the unified instruction, then moving hardware to the data cache size could be a good design option.</p><p>Once the unified indexed vector load instruction is dispatched to the vector memory unit, two entries in VMIT are reserved. The first entry controls loading of index values, while the second entry is responsible for getting final values. As additional hardware, we need only two buffers. The first buffer holds index values that are received from the data cache. Since packets that contain index values can return out of order due to cache misses, we need the second buffer, where each value indicates the position in the vector register for each index value in the first buffer. As explained earlier, index values are stored in a vector register. Once a corresponding element in the vector register is selected to be written, the ID number is written in the second buffer.

The initial idea was to add hardware that detects packets with indices (with the unit-stride vector load), buffer them, and initiate accesses for the indexed vector load at the cache side. We realized that it would need to communicate with the TLB in some cases (e.g., if the index value is higher than the TLB page size) in order to perform the address translation. We also realized that the indexed vector loaded by unit-stride vector load is often used by several subsequent vector instructions and that we will still need to transfer those values to the vector register file. Therefore, we decided to move the additional hardware to the vector memory unit (see Section 2.2), where most of the existing hardware can be reused to support execution of a unified indexed vector load. If the index values are just used in the unified instruction, then moving hardware to the data cache size could be a good design option.</p>",

Speedup for CVU, OBO, and BBE with full (FCS) and restricted (RCS) chaining support from memory hierarchy over the scalar baseline.</p><p>is important for the second part of the unified instruction in order to write the final values in the right position in the destination vector register. The size of the buffers is equal to the size of vector registers.</p><p>Our current implementation supports forwarding between older stores and subsequent loads based on addresses that are used in load instructions to get data. Since we will not have the address of the final value until we receive the corresponding index value from the data cache, we decided to apply a conservative approach during the execution of the unified instruction. Our unified instruction waits for all older vector stores to complete before it starts execution. Particularly, with the kernel graph500, it is possible that there is a conflict between older vector stores and subsequent vector loads because both access the same array. It means that subsequent vector loads could access a value that is written by older vector stores. Therefore, our conservative approach is required. If we are sure that there is no collision between stores and loads, a weak ordering mechanism, as in the latest NEC SX-ACE machine [Mosome et al. 2014], could be applied.</p><h2>5. EVALUATION OF ENHANCED INTEGRATED DESIGN</h2><p>In this section, we evaluate and present results for the techniques described in the previous section.</p><h3>5.1. Chaining from the Memory Hierarchy</h3><p>Figure 12 presents the speedups achieved with our two proposed approaches over the scalar baseline: full chaining support (FCS) and restricted chaining support (RCS). Figure 13 presents the speedups achieved over the same models of execution without chaining. We used 16 chaining elements for FCS and four for RCS.</p><p>There are several interesting points in these figures. The difference in speedup for FCS and RCS is negligible or nonexistent for almost all kernels in all three models,</p>",

Since we will not have the address of the final value until we receive the corresponding index value from the data cache, we decided to apply a conservative approach during the execution of the unified instruction. Our unified instruction waits for all older vector stores to complete before it starts execution. Particularly, with the kernel graph500, it is possible that there is a conflict between older vector stores and subsequent vector loads because both access the same array. It means that subsequent vector loads could access a value that is written by older vector stores. Therefore, our conservative approach is required. If we are sure that there is no collision between stores and loads, a weak ordering mechanism, as in the latest NEC SX-ACE machine [Mosome et al. 2014], could be applied.</p>",

Therefore, for our target design where area and power are the most important constraints, RCS can provide good results for the most of kernels.</p><p>Each kernel has different trends, and we analyze them case by case. FCS provides up to 17% improvement in <i>sphinx-a</i> for <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, while <i>BBE</i> does not benefit a lot from chaining for this kernel. <i>BBE</i> without chaining already has significant speedup over <i>CVU</i> and <i>BBE</i> (see Section 3.1). This speedup is mainly due to overlapped execution of vector memory and computational instructions in <i>BBE</i>. The single L1 D-cache port is already almost fully utilized, and therefore chaining is not able to provide additional significant performance improvements. The speedup of <i>BBE</i> over <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> is reduced from 40% to 20% with chaining. <i>Sphinx-a</i> does not benefit at all from RCS for <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, while there is a small speedup for <i>BBE</i> and shorter MVLs. Applications with strided and indexed vector loads can benefit more from chaining because memory instructions have a longer execution time. This is the reason we obtained the highest speedup with chaining for <i>sphinx-a</i>. <i>BBE</i> benefits the most from FCS in <i>sphinx-b</i>, around 16% for MVL 16. <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> also experience improvements higher than 10%, and trends are consistent across different MVLs. We knew that unit-stride vector loads are fast (whole cache line per access), but we still expected better results for <i>saxpy</i>, speedup increases around 5% for <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, while <i>BBE</i> has slightly better results, up to 9.5% for MVL 64. The dataset for <i>saxpy</i> is cache resident, so we decided to perform a test to pollute the L1 data cache before <i>saxpy</i> starts computation. The results that are then obtained for <i>CVU</i> show a 20.5% improvement for MVL 32. This means that applications with poor cache locality can benefit a lot from chaining from memory hierarchy, similarly to the applications with strided and indexed memory instructions. Table VII shows L1 data cache miss rates for current data input sets and MVL 32. Speedups are the same for FCS and RCS in</p>",

          "html": "<p>Each kernel has different trends, and we analyze them case by case. FCS provides up to 17% improvement in <i>sphinx-a</i> for <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, while <i>BBE</i> does not benefit a lot from chaining for this kernel. <i>BBE</i> without chaining already has significant speedup over <i>CVU</i> and <i>BBE</i> (see Section 3.1). This speedup is mainly due to overlapped execution of vector memory and computational instructions in <i>BBE</i>. The single L1 D-cache port is already almost fully utilized, and therefore chaining is not able to provide additional significant performance improvements. The speedup of <i>BBE</i> over <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> is reduced from 40% to 20% with chaining. <i>Sphinx-a</i> does not benefit at all from RCS for <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, while there is a small speedup for <i>BBE</i> and shorter MVLs. Applications with strided and indexed vector loads can benefit more from chaining because memory instructions have a longer execution time. This is the reason we obtained the highest speedup with chaining for <i>sphinx-a</i>. <i>BBE</i> benefits the most from FCS in <i>sphinx-b</i>, around 16% for MVL 16. <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> also experience improvements higher than 10%, and trends are consistent across different MVLs. We knew that unit-stride vector loads are fast (whole cache line per access), but we still expected better results for <i>saxpy</i>, speedup increases around 5% for <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i>, while <i>BBE</i> has slightly better results, up to 9.5% for MVL 64. The dataset for <i>saxpy</i> is cache resident, so we decided to perform a test to pollute the L1 data cache before <i>saxpy</i> starts computation. The results that are then obtained for <i>CVU</i> show a 20.5% improvement for MVL 32. This means that applications with poor cache locality can benefit a lot from chaining from memory hierarchy, similarly to the applications with strided and indexed memory instructions. Table VII shows L1 data cache miss rates for current data input sets and MVL 32. Speedups are the same for FCS and RCS in</p>",

The difference in execution time between <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> or <i>BBE</i> with chaining is only 1.4% for MVL 128, while it was 9.5% without chaining. <i>h264ref</i> does not benefit at all from chaining. The reason is the short vector length of the loop, combined with the unit-stride access. The vector load is able to bring all 16 elements from the data cache with one access. Therefore, chaining does not play any role in this case. We also expected higher speedups for <i>hmmr</i>, but we observed that the execution of consecutive vector computational instructions is serialized. The reason is that a unit-stride vector load is followed by several vector computational instructions that are all of the same type. Since there is only one ALU for that operation that they must share, the first instruction can start execution a few cycles earlier, while the rest of the instructions still need to wait for the ALU. Adding another ALU could overcome this issue. <i>CVU</i> does not benefit from chaining in <i>graph500</i>, while chaining provides almost 6% improvement for <i>OBO</i> and <i>BBE</i>. <i>OBO</i> and <i>BBE</i> provide almost the same speedups with chaining as <i>CVU</i> for <i>graph500</i>.</p><p>Table VIII shows how often chaining is used. The first column lists the kernels. The second column shows the number of vector loads per single iteration in a vectorized kernel, while the last column shows how many vector loads are chained. We can observe that the chaining from vector loads is quite often used in most of the vectorized kernels, except in <i>h264ref</i> and <i>facerec</i>.</p><p>The area overhead of adding chaining logic from the memory hierarchy depends on the size of the vector register. The area for <i>FCS</i> ranges from 0.4% for MVL 16 up to 2.6% for MVL 128 in <i>OBO</i> or <i>BBE</i>. It is around 19% of the total area overhead for <i>OBO</i> or <i>BBE</i> for MVL 128. This percentage is lower for <i>CVU</i> since it has a larger total area. <i>RCS</i> contributes four times less area overhead and it is around 5% of the total area overhead for <i>OBO</i> or <i>BBE</i> for MVL 128.</p><p>The dynamic power contribution of <i>FCS</i> or <i>RCS</i> to the total dynamic power is always lower than 1% for all kernels. Regarding energy consumption for <i>FCS</i>, there is up to 6% savings for <i>sphinx-a</i> and <i>saxpy</i> in <i>CVU</i>, while the rest of the kernels are in the range of 2%. Savings are smaller for <i>RCS</i> in <i>CVU</i>, up to 2.8% for <i>sphinx-b</i>. Savings are similar for <i>OBO</i> and <i>BBE</i>. Some kernels have higher energy consumption over models without chaining for higher MVLs and <i>RCS</i>, but it is 1.6% in the worst case for <i>sphinx-a</i> with MVL 128 in <i>BBE</i>.</p>",

The difference in execution time between <i>CVU</i> and <i>OBO</i> or <i>BBE</i> with chaining is only 1.4% for MVL 128, while it was 9.5% without chaining. <i>h264ref</i> does not benefit at all from chaining. The reason is the short vector length of the loop, combined with the unit-stride access. The vector load is able to bring all 16 elements from the data cache with one access. Therefore, chaining does not play any role in this case. We also expected higher speedups for <i>hmmr</i>, but we observed that the execution of consecutive vector computational instructions is serialized. The reason is that a unit-stride vector load is followed by several vector computational instructions that are all of the same type. Since there is only one ALU for that operation that they must share, the first instruction can start execution a few cycles earlier, while the rest of the instructions still need to wait for the ALU. Adding another ALU could overcome this issue. <i>CVU</i> does not benefit from chaining in <i>graph500</i>, while chaining provides almost 6% improvement for <i>OBO</i> and <i>BBE</i>. <i>OBO</i> and <i>BBE</i> provide almost the same speedups with chaining as <i>CVU</i> for <i>graph500</i>.</p>",

Speed-up for <i>CVU</i>, <i>OBO</i>, and <i>BBE</i> over the scalar baseline when using vmshape.</p></div><p block-type=\"Text\">All these numbers suggest that chaining from memory hierarchy is fruitful for most of the kernels in terms of performance and energy savings with small area overheads. The contribution of chaining logic to the total dynamic power is also negligible.</p><h2><span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>5.2. Direct Forwarding</h2><p block-type=\"Text\">We evaluated this technique in terms of energy and power in McPAT, and the results are presented in Figure 14. Using this technique does not affect the performance results. Obtained results show that we can save more than 50% of energy/power of the vector register file in sphinx-a, sphinx-b, and hmmer. h264ref, saxpy, and facerec have decent savings between 33% and 16%. Depending on the size of the vector register, savings at the CPU level range from 2.5% for short vector registers (16 elements) up to 11% for MVL of 128 elements for sphinx-b.</p><p block-type=\"Text\">The results presented in this subsection show the benefit of applying this technique between vector arithmetic instructions. It would be possible to achieve even further savings in the vector register file if this technique is combined with chaining from the memory hierarchy to provide direct forward for vector memory instructions as well. This idea is more challenging because it will require more complex logic to implement it and the proposed solution should not affect the performance results. We leave this for future work.</p><h3>5.3. Vmshape Instruction</h3><p block-type=\"Text\">Figure 15 shows the speedups for CVU, OBO, and BBE over the scalar baseline for facerec with vmshape. We presented results both with and without chaining from the memory hierarchy. vmshape increases speedup from <math display=\"inline\">1.63 \\times</math> to <math display=\"inline\">2.4 \\times</math> for CVU and OBO using MVL 64, while the speedup is increased from <math display=\"inline\">1.77 \\times</math> to <math display=\"inline\">2.66 \\times</math> for BBE. Chaining from the memory hierarchy also additionally improves performance (from <math display=\"inline\">2.4 \\times</math> to <math display=\"inline\">2.68 \\times</math> for CVU and OBO). It is also interesting that performance scales better with increased MVL from 16 to 64 elements compared to the implementation without support for vmshape (Figure 5). We also modeled the additional hardware in McPAT, and results show negligible area overheads (less than 0.2%), while energy savings are almost proportional to the achieved speedup (from 9% for MVL 16 up to 18% for longer MVLs).</p><h3>5.4. Unified Indexed Vector Load</h3><p block-type=\"Text\">Figure 16 shows the speedups for the vectorized version of graph500 using the unified vector load over the version with the indexed vector load. Results are presented with and without chaining from the memory hierarchy for all three models of execution:</p>",

Speedup with the unified vector load over the indexed vector load in <i>graph500</i> for <i>CVU</i>, <i>OBO</i>, and <i>BBE</i>.</p><p><i>CVU</i>, <i>OBO</i>, and <i>BBE</i>. The unified vector load instruction increases speedup only up to <math>1.08\\times</math> for <i>CVU</i> without chaining from memory. Results are similar with chaining from the memory hierarchy. We profiled execution of both vectorized versions and we found that the unified vector load completes execution faster than the indexed vector load. The speedup per single instruction goes from <math>1.1\\times</math> to <math>1.22\\times</math>. Since the rest of the kernel is the same, overall speedup goes only up to <math>1.08\\times</math>. We also noticed that loading all neighboring nodes and their current state (visited or not visited) takes a few hundreds cycles (300\u2013400) for 30 neighboring nodes on average. Therefore, the benefit of having a single instruction and saving some cycles in the front end of the processor is also small in this particular example. The area overhead of the additional hardware is small, less than 0.3% in the worst case when two buffers with 128 elements are added. Energy savings are also small and proportional to the speedups, less than 4.1%, while dynamic power increases up to 8%.</p><p>Even though current results are not promising, the unified indexed vector load could be further improved. For example, if the index vector is used only in the unified vector load instruction, we could avoid writing to the vector register. We also noticed that a cache line that holds only neighbors of one node (index values) is accessed only once. We could avoid caching these lines in L1 or L2 and provide a small victim cache or streaming buffer for those lines. Therefore, L1 and/or L2 caches would not be polluted with cache lines that are used only once.</p><h2>6. RELATED WORK</h2><p>In this section, we discuss differences between our integrated design and several works that combine vector and scalar processing. We also discuss alternatives to vectors and justify design decisions.</p><p>An important characteristic of most microprocessor vector architectures is that the vector processing unit is designed as an extension or coprocessor to a scalar core, but there are few works that combine vector and scalar processing on the same substrate. Quintana et al. [1999] added a vector unit to a superscalar core. Since their research focused on high performance, this processor design resembles a classic vector with multiple lanes and direct L2 access, which is completely different from our design. This work also does not include any evaluation of power and energy of the proposed design, even though their approach requires additional hardware that is idle most of the time in scalar-intensive applications. Gebis [2008] proposed the first integrated so-</p>",

Therefore, the benefit of having a single instruction and saving some cycles in the front end of the processor is also small in this particular example. The area overhead of the additional hardware is small, less than 0.3% in the worst case when two buffers with 128 elements are added.

We have observed the advantages of using vector computation instructions, for example, the energy reduction due to reduced front-end activity. Soliman [2011] proposed a low-complexity vector core that has a common execution datapath for executing scalar/vector instructions, but using the scalar register file limits the design to support only a short vector (up to eight elements). PTX Compute [2010] supports vector instructions, but they are transformed to scalar instructions for Nvidia SIMT microarchitectures, which behave like many independent scalar units. This can be seen in an instance of using scalar hardware to execute vector instructions.</p><p>Combined vector-scalar design is also proposed in CELL and power processors [Gschwind et al. 2006; Gschwind 2006, 2016]. Cell and power processors target high performance, and it is crucial for them to have parallel hardware that can exploit available DLP and provide high performance. Since they realized the importance of coupling closely vector-scalar processing, support for scalar execution is added in the parallel hardware (SIMD vector unit). In our work, we are targeting the low-end embedded market, where power, energy, and area are important design concerns. So we used the <i>opposite</i> approach: we added minimal hardware to support execution of traditional vector instructions (not SIMD) on a scalar in-order core.</p><p>The Imagine processor [Khailany et al. 2001] implements a somewhat similar model of execution to our <i>BBE</i>. The authors called it compound stream operations. They perform multiple computational operations on each stream element. Our <i>BBE</i> model is more flexible, as instructions in the block can be independent. Imagine targets streaming applications with little data reuse, while our approach is more general. Their model of execution is implemented on specific accelerators, while <i>BBE</i> works on a generalized-purpose core and does not have any specific constraint. It can use regular vectorized code and execute in a block-based fashion without additional support from the compiler. The SCALE processor [Krashinsky et al. 2004] also implements a kind of block-based execution at the level of a virtual processor (VP). VP instructions (RISC-like) are grouped into atomic instruction blocks (AIBs), which is the unit of work issued to a VP at one time. Despite the common use of the term \u201cblock,\u201d our <i>BBE</i> blocks are completely distinct from AIBs. In our case, it is a block of vector instructions that is dynamically formed during execution. Similar to Imagine, <i>BBE</i> can execute regular vector code without additional compiler support.</p><p>BERET [Gupta et al. 2011] and DySER [Govindaraju et al. 2011] are architectures that provide reconfigurable datapaths to accelerate critical subgraphs of computation within a loop iteration, while XLOOPS [Srinath et al. 2014] deals with interiteration loop dependence patterns. Govindaraju et al. [2013] tuned a compiler to generate optimized code for DySER that can be seen as an alternative to SIMD. DySER, BERET, and XLOOPS are accelerators, in which critical subgraphs or loops are executed on dedicated additional hardware that their has own functional units, while we use existing functional units in our integrated design. They also extensively modified compilers to provide support for corresponding execution model, while our blocks are formed dynamically during execution. We just needed small support in a compiler for the direct forwarding technique.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that we use <i>traditional vector execution</i> (Cray-I inspired) in our integrated design rather than SIMD implementations found in commodity processors such as Intel/AMD X86, Cell, Power, and so forth. SIMD processing units operate in parallel, requiring multiple functional units, and thus they are less efficient solutions in area and energy for embedded systems. Additionally, even when focusing on high performance, execution of vector instructions in a pipelined form is still a relevant design point.

Each pipeline can execute up to four operations per cycle, but each vector register has 256 elements; thus, each instruction is pipelined serially in the functional units, unlike SIMD-based architectures.</p><p>NEON is an SIMD unit incorporated in ARM processors. We predict that area overhead of the NEON unit would be similar or higher to CVU in the case of the 128-bit SIMD FP unit. Regarding performance, NEON should provide better performance for cache-friendly applications with unit-stride access and short vectors: NEON is able to process two or four operations in parallel, while we chose to provide a single vector lane. The advantages of our design would be apparent in applications with long vectors (due to the smaller code size and reduced dynamic instruction count, resulting in less front-end activity) and irregular memory access patterns\u2014strided or indexed memory accesses (NEON only supports vectors that are stored consecutively in memory and therefore code with indexed or strided memory access patterns cannot be vectorized). Cache-unfriendly applications would also benefit greatly from using long vectors because vector memory instructions are able to hide long latencies.</p><p>The <i>OBO</i> mode of execution is similar to the ARM's VFP mode [Seal 2000] for FP computation, but there are still some differences. Our <i>OBO</i> model supports longer vector lengths, while VFP is restricted to shorter vector lengths. Also, we provide support for gather/scatter vector memory instructions. We applied chaining for computational vector instructions as well as chaining from memory hierarchy. Moreover, the execution of vector instructions with integer data is also different, since our model uses scalar ALUs.</p><p>Our baseline is an energy-efficient in-order ARM core, and we wanted to improve it in terms of energy and performance. Since vector processors are by default energy efficient [Lemuet et al. 2006], we added support for vector instructions. We did not consider adding multiple lanes for the following reasons: (1) we wanted to do minimal changes to the existing scalar processor in order to keep the area/power envelope and reuse the existing processor resources in the most efficient way, and (2) adding one additional lane increases the area of the scalar baseline by 44%, and adding four lanes will more than double the area of the processor and it is not acceptable in highly constrained low-end devices.</p><p>Early vector processors had single lane architectures (CRAY-1) and they were successful compared to others in that era such as IBM370. Efficiency was the factor. By analogy, in-order processors are overwhelmingly used in the embedded domain because they are more energy efficient compared to bulky out-of-order architectures. Recent work demonstrates that single-lane vector units offer significant performance gains over commodity processors [Hayes et al. 2012]. It shows quite clearly that the advantages come from a reduction of fetch/decode/renaming/commit and consolidating memory requests together. Our results in the article also confirmed that we can achieve good speedups over the scalar baseline.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, chaining from the memory hierarchy was popular in classic vector machines [Russell 1978; Sch\u00f6nauer 1987]. Since access time to the memory hierarchy was constant, it was not very difficult to implement it. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published work that discusses how to implement chaining from memory hierarchy with caches.</p><p>Regarding direct forwarding, it can be seen as an extreme case of short-lived registers [Ponomarev et al. 2003; Hu and Martonosi 2000] because we are using each produced value only once. Short-lived registers or values are used only for a short period of time after they are written, meaning that the destination registers targeted by these values are renamed by the time the results are written back. Writing to the register file is avoided by caching in a small dedicated register file [Ponomarev et al.</p>",

Moreover, the execution of vector instructions with integer data is also different, since our model uses scalar ALUs.</p>",

CONCLUSION</h2><p>Using a vector processor is one of the most energy-efficient ways of achieving high performance for a wide number of applications that contain significant DLP. Power dissipation, energy consumption, and area are critical concerns in processor design, especially for embedded systems in the low-end market. In this article, we propose the integrated vector-scalar design. The integrated design allows for execution of vector computational instructions mostly reusing resources of an ARM in-order core. We implement two models to execute vector computational instructions: one-by-one and block-based execution models. To provide additional performance improvements, we propose and implement chaining from the memory hierarchy with relatively small area and power overheads. We also implement restricted chaining from the memory hierarchy that minimizes area overhead and provides the same performance improvements for most of the evaluated kernels compared to the first approach. The key advantages are that our integrated design (1) applies vector-scalar processing automatically in hardware, (b) gains the advantages of a vector ISA, and (c) applies several energy/performance-efficient techniques to reduce power and increase performance in a mobile CPU.</p><p>Our integrated design has several advantages. It has small area and power overheads (only 4.66% when using a vector register with 32 elements), while at the same time the <i>BBE</i> model provides even better FP performance results (up to <math>1.4\\times</math>) compared to <i>CVU</i>. As a result, not only is a significant reduction of energy over the scalar achieved (up to <math>5\\times</math>), as expected due to the energy efficiency of vector architectures, but also the integrated design consumes less energy than <i>CVU</i> (up to 26% of reduction). Direct forwarding is applied to <i>BBE</i> and it provides additional power/energy savings in the vector register file (up to 57%). We propose three other energy/performance-efficient techniques that reduce power and increase performance in our integrated design. Generally speaking, our three advanced techniques (chaining from the memory hierarchy, vector memory shape instruction, and unified vector load) provide improvements for applications with indexed or strided memory access patterns including 2D strided access (Sphinx3, Graph500, and Facerec). One of them (chaining from the memory hierarchy) also provides improvements for applications with poor temporal cache locality such as saxpy. Applications in which often the result of one instruction is only consumed by one of the subsequent instructions will benefit from direct forwarding.</p><p>Obviously, not all aspects of the integrated design are perfect and there are a few open issues. In our future work, we will work on an evaluation of <i>BBE</i>'s control logic at the circuit level to accurately study the complexity/power/performance tradeoffs of its design. An implementation at the circuit level will determine if the changes to the hardware affect the critical path and maximum operating frequency. Another concern is that <i>CVU</i>, <i>OBO</i>, and <i>BBE</i> are sensitive to the order of the instructions in the program because they are all in order. This could be partially relieved with decoupling [Espasa and Valero 1996], but careful power evaluation should be performed to ensure it does not compromise the savings achieved with the proposed architecture.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p>Krste Asanovic.

Power dissipation, energy consumption, and area are critical concerns in processor design, especially for embedded systems in the low-end market. In this article, we propose the integrated vector-scalar design. The integrated design allows for execution of vector computational instructions mostly reusing resources of an ARM in-order core. We implement two models to execute vector computational instructions: one-by-one and block-based execution models. To provide additional performance improvements, we propose and implement chaining from the memory hierarchy with relatively small area and power overheads. We also implement restricted chaining from the memory hierarchy that minimizes area overhead and provides the same performance improvements for most of the evaluated kernels compared to the first approach. The key advantages are that our integrated design (1) applies vector-scalar processing automatically in hardware, (b) gains the advantages of a vector ISA, and (c) applies several energy/performance-efficient techniques to reduce power and increase performance in a mobile CPU.</p>",

It has small area and power overheads (only 4.66% when using a vector register with 32 elements), while at the same time the <i>BBE</i> model provides even better FP performance results (up to <math>1.4\\times</math>) compared to <i>CVU</i>. As a result, not only is a significant reduction of energy over the scalar achieved (up to <math>5\\times</math>), as expected due to the energy efficiency of vector architectures, but also the integrated design consumes less energy than <i>CVU</i> (up to 26% of reduction). Direct forwarding is applied to <i>BBE</i> and it provides additional power/energy savings in the vector register file (up to 57%). We propose three other energy/performance-efficient techniques that reduce power and increase performance in our integrated design. Generally speaking, our three advanced techniques (chaining from the memory hierarchy, vector memory shape instruction, and unified vector load) provide improvements for applications with indexed or strided memory access patterns including 2D strided access (Sphinx3, Graph500, and Facerec). One of them (chaining from the memory hierarchy) also provides improvements for applications with poor temporal cache locality such as saxpy. Applications in which often the result of one instruction is only consumed by one of the subsequent instructions will benefit from direct forwarding.</p>",

An implementation at the circuit level will determine if the changes to the hardware affect the critical path and maximum operating frequency. Another concern is that <i>CVU</i>, <i>OBO</i>, and <i>BBE</i> are sensitive to the order of the instructions in the program because they are all in order. This could be partially relieved with decoupling [Espasa and Valero 1996], but careful power evaluation should be performed to ensure it does not compromise the savings achieved with the proposed architecture.</p>",
